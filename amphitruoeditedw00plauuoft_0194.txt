134 AMPHITRVO. PROL.

strikes me as a likely word to have dropped out. pater
optumus maximus is well known, and pafer optumus was not
uncommon3 Hor. Sat. 1. 4. 105, insuevit pater optimus hoc
me; Ibid. 2. 1. 12, cupidum pater optime vires Deficiunt.
Here optumus may be used with some reference to bonis in
me next verse. It is not likely, as suggested in the Crit.
Note, that pater meus formed an exception, as a common
phrase, equivalent to one word, to the law stated. The only line
which seems to suggest that idea, illen. 5. 1. 50, Νε39α8 novisse
me ,9 neqas patrem meum, ending with three Iambic words is
universally condemned, and meus pater is the usual order. Ι
would write that verse thus, Neyas novisse med ? iqnoras m'e'um
patrem? M alam erucem and bonafide, which are both treated
as one word, are the only certain exceptions. See A. Luchs,

in Studernund's Studien, vol. 1.

47. exprobraret. Cic. Lael. 20. 71, odiosum sane ,qe‘nus
hominum officia exprobrantium. Ter. Andr. 1. ’1. 16, istaec
commemoratio Quasi exprobratiosc immemori benefici. quod
boni: the genitive is usually separated from quod in this
phrase : Rud. 4. 7. 3, habeas quod di dant boni.

48. gratum: passive, ‘received with thanks‚’ a meaning
yram-9 osten has. Ter. And. 1. 1. 15, et id yratum fuisse
adversum te habeo gyratiam ‚· Pers. 4. 5. 3, Si quid bonis Boni
fit esse idem yrave et yratum solet. But sslost. 1. 3. 63, Eun-
(lem animum oportet nunc mihi esse gratum ut impetravi can
scarcely be sound : Sonnenschein concurs with me in thinking
that oratum should be restored for yratum. a vobis ‘ on your
part ’ ε the preposition is used because yrcztum is passive in
sense Ξ orato animo a vobis acceptum.

52. quid. contraxistis frontem. Cf. Juv. 13. 215, densissima,
ruya eogyitur in frontem. Lucilius speaks of a spectator

(Nonius, p. 30),
Verum tristis contorto aliquo ex Pacuviano exordio.

This passage by itself would show that tragedy was unpopular
at Rome : and how could it be otherwise? Those stiff transla-
tions of Greek originals‚ without the Greek spirit, Greek local
pride in mythical traditions‚ without the Greek religion which
gave a meaning and an elevation to the whole, how could they
he popular among earnest, simple, good-humoured Romans?
