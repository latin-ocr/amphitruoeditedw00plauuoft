. A normal bacchiac tetrameter is 1. 1. 21 ι
Habendum et ferundum hoc onust cum labore.

The chief variations are the substitution of a
molossus for a bacchius, 2. 2. 10:

Sed 11όο 1110 beat saltem quom perduellis 3

the substitution of ionic a minore for the molossus
its first syllable being resolved:

Hodie qui fuerim liber eum nunc 3

the substitution of the ionic a maiore for the molossus,
its last syllable being resolved‚ Capt. 5. 1. 3 :

Quomque ex miseriis plurimis me exemerunt.

We also find the variation of the ionic anaclomenos,
i.e. a third paeon, followed by a second epitrito,
forming a colon, Amph. 2. 2. 2 :

Ita quoique comparatumst.

This is treated by Seyffert, followed by Leo, as an
iambic colon.

As the cretic favours the trochee, the bacchius
favours the iambus, and clausulae of bacchiac
systems are generally in iambic metre or sometimes
anapaestic.

Seyffert has laid it down as a test of a bacchias:
line that it must contain one pure thesis, i.e. contain
one pure bacchius. This is, no doubt, generally
true. I have, however, taken the liberty of dis-
regarding it in one very uncertain line, 2. 2. 19.
