1⁶21. Iugulae, the old Latin name for the constellation called
‘ Orion’s beltfi It is probably a diminutive from iuqum, ‘ a
yoke.’ Varro, who quotes this vs„ L.L. 7. 50, and Festus
give iuqula as the name of the constellation. Manilius, 5.
174. 5, gives the plural form, but he seems to understand a

different constellation :-

Nunc Cancro vicina canam, cui parte sinistrae
Consurgunt Iugulae.

These, according to Schneider, are the Aselli.

Vesperugo, the old name for Vesper, Hesperus, ‘the
evening star,⁷ Varro, L.L. 7. 50.

Vergiliae, the Roman name for the Pleiads, Prop. 1. 8. 10;
Et sit iners tardis navita Vergiliis.

The word is probably derived from rit-qa, and means a bunch
of switches (poifflze'e cle remes), which the constellation re-

Mero. 5. 211:
Egomet mihi comes, calator, equos, agaso, armiger.

124. datam pulcre locas, ‘ you make a good investment of
your services so given.' Locare is regularly used of investing
money, as ‘to place ⁷ is sometimes with us. Most. 3. 1. 4, Locare
arqenti nemini nummum queo. Cf. Allo-st. 1. 3. 144. Also of
investing a kindness : Livy 7. 20, locare beneficium apud gyrato-2
Ennius 389 (Ribb.), Benefacta male locata male facta arbi—
tror. Plautus uses locare also of a father betrothing his
daughter, Aul. 2. 2. 15, as well as in its common sense of
giving a contract for a thing to be done, Pers. 1. 3. 80. Ponere
