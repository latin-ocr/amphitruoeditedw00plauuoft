190 AMPHITRVO. ACT 11.

Ubi primum ted ibi sensisti mulier impliciscier? Fortasse
governs an accusative and infinitive in Plautus. Hence
Ussing's conjecture. He defends it by Asin. 37, Ubi fit
polenta te forta tsse dicere; Qid. 293, Ady qua rlrayinta fortasse
eam posse emi minimo minis; Mero. 770, Fortass e te illum
mirari coquom. In these passages the accusative is expressed.
It is understood in Poen. 1007, Fortasse ‘medicos nos esse
arbitrarier. This is a good conjecture, but the text is prob-

ably sound. See on vs. 28 supra.

77. somniculose, the second syllable is long, as in meticulosus,
pediculo-sus, febriculosus. Cf. Mart. 3. 58, Somniculosos ille
porriyit diras, a scazon, ‘ sleepy dormice.’

80. quis homo: 1. l. 155 supra.

81. blatis = blateras, ‘prate’ The dictionaries make the
present Matio, but only the 2nd sing. is found. It occurs
three times in Plautus, Cure. 3. 8. 2, Epid. 3. 1. 13, and it is
uncertain whether the present is blato or blatio. The form

blato, blata-s is given in glossaries.
83. istuc exquisito est opus: 1. 3. 7, supra.

84-87. Ussing notices the blemishes in these verses, and
condemns them as spurious. He says ( 1) that Amphitruo is
not, in his present state of mind, likely to trouble himself

about giving a command about his property on the ship. (2)
That he would not, in the same breath, tell Sosia to follow
him, and to see to landing the moveables ; (3) that Sosia had
drunk no wine, and the last line but one implies he had. (4)
That the suspected verses abound with faults, et numerorum et
orationis vitiis abundant. The last statement is exaggerated,
but the three first arguments will incline the reader to agree

with Ussing.

84. iam precedes imperavi in the MSS„ but transpositions of
pairs of words are very common in the Plautine codices.

85. compareant. The general use of comparere is ‘to be
forthcoming.' Here the meaning must be ‘ that there may be
something to show for your commands.'

86. Ι would read interbibi for ebibi to cure the hiatus. Cf.
Aul. 3. 6. 22, Quae mi interbibere sola si vino scalae Corinth·
iensem fontem Pirenem potest. simitu = simul, very common
