sc, Ι. - NOTES (323-341). 163

177. Certe enim, ‘ surely some one is talking here.’ enim .·
see on 2. 2. 26 infra.

178. nescioquem, ‘ somebody,’ like Οὖτις, Ulysses's pseu-
donym ‘ Nobody.' certo, ‘ of a truth ’z on the difference be-
tween cerlo and certe, see Langen, p. 22-31.

179. enim, ‘yes‚' see 177. dextera: abl. Ι am not sure
that I am right in abandoning the order of the MSS. with
Goetz and Leo. dextera might be pronounced as if written
(lextra. Mueller in his Nachlray withdraws the statement
he had made on Ritschl’s authority that <lextra is never
dissyllabic in Plautus, quoting Alere. 965, Getta dextras min-
ciam, and 879, Respice ad dextram Charine. See note on
prospere, 1. 2. l infra. verberat: Cf. Tac. Ayr. 41, Quibus
sermonibus· satis constat Domitiani quoque aures verberatas.
Most 4. 1. 204, πο ‘mihi ut surdo verbera aures.

180. vicem, ‘ in place of. ' Vicem is an adverbial accusative.
Cf. Capi. 2. 3. 37, αὐ eum redimat: et remittat nostrum huc
amborum vicem. spIost. 2. l. 8, meam vicem. Truc. 1. 2. 57,
et nostram et illorum vicem.

184. ilicet, ‘it is all over.' ‘⁴ C’est fait de moi ! '² Moliere's
Amph. Act 1. Sc. 2. ilicet, properly ire licet, is said to have
been a formula pronounced by the crier dismissing judices at
the conclusion of a case, Donatus on Phorm. 1. 4. 31, or spec-
tators at the end of a sacrifice, or the senate, Servius on Aen.
2. 424. It is often used as an exclamation of despair, like actum
est, with which it was often joined. Cio-t. 4. 2. 17, actum est ,Ι
ilicet! me infelicem et scelestam ,· Ter. Eun. 1. 1. 9, actumst,
ilicet, peristi ,· Ibid 2. 4. 57, ilicet .· desine: iam conclamatumsc.

185. conloqui takes the accusative many times in Plautus :
cf. 3. 2. 17 infra, te volo, uxor conloqui. The construction
with cum is much rarer, Pers. 4. 2. 73 4. 7. 18. contra: ad-
verbial‚ as generally, Brix and Tyrrell say always in Plautus.

186. qui, the abl. which has grown into a conjunction
z quo, ut.

187. Volcanum in cornu. The bombastic grandiloquence of
these words at once recalls Pistol to the reader’s mind, a
character of whom we are often thus reminded in Plautus.
Lanterns were often made of horn in ancient times. Ussing
quotes Athen. 15. 699f, κερατίνου δὲ φωσφόρου λύχνου σέλας.
