last syllable is long: Aul. 4. 8. 12 ε Acade, eccum ipsum ; ibo ut
koc condam domum ; Ter. And. 1. l. 125: Percussit ilico
animum .· attat, hoc illud est. ilico, see Crit. Note. illic, the
old dative of ille, does not seem to me so probable, so soon
after illic, nom.

110. nocedie. The very large number of instances of hiatus
that may be cured by writing hocedz‘e for hodie, joined to the
express testimony of Marius Victorinus quoted in the Critical
Note, form sufficient justification for the introduction of this
form into the text. In this play alone at least four instances
of hiatus are thus corrected. See index s.v. hocedie.

111. eludere ε ‘ baffle,' ‘ delude‚' ‘ make sport of.’ So Pers.
5. 2. 24: quin elude, ut voles. Ter. Eun. 1. 1. 103 Phorm. 5.
7. 2. Langen however only allows to eludere in Plautus the
sense of ‘ winning> a thing at play’: anulum quem parasitus
hic te elusit, Cure. 5. 2. 31. In the sense of ‘ fooling’ he says
Plautus only used ludere, deludere, ludos facere or luclq'ftcare
(i), and alters eludere to ludere or deludere when this sense is
required.

112. med for me is a much safer correctiOn than to write
huiusce with Ussing, a form which Plautus seems to have
avoided ε see not-e on Prol. 96, supra.

114. malum, ‘ roguish'3 malitia, ‘roguishness‚' has in
Plautus obtained a sense in which ‘cunning,' ‘ cleverness,' is
a more prominent idea than wickedness: cf. Pers. 1. 3. 73;
Ter tanto peior ipsa est, quam illam tu esse vis.

115. telo suo sibi: sibi in such cases intensifies sua: it is
generally used as a “ dativus 2'ncom1nodi,'' when something is
done fo the detrimem‘ of a person by his own instruments. So
Ter. Ad. 5. 8. 35, suo sibi qlaclio hunc inquld: Truc. 3. 2. 30,
male accipiar mea mihi pecunia: but that this sense of detri—
ment is not in the words themselves is shown by such phrases
as suo sibi qnam, As, 4. 2. 16, simply ‘his very own son';
Mil. 3. 1. 38 z I nest in hoc amasa-item sua sihi ingenua indoles,
‘ this man has a gentlema-nly nat-ure peculiarly his own.'

117. quod certo sciam, ‘which I am sure of.’ Certo scire
is ‘I know for a certainty'; certe scio, ‘I certainly know’
(it- is certainly true that Ι know). Certo is only used by the
comic poets and Cicero, chiefly iu his letters. Gerae belongs
