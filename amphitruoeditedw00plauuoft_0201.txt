army. Cf. Truc. Q, 6. ⁶27, lam masma-et? iamne it ad [θρίο-
nem ? ecquae spolia rettulit ,2

143. petasus (πετάννυμι) : a hat with a broad brim, worn by
travellers. Mercury is represented with such a hat with
wings (pinnulae) at the sides. These are absent in Sosia’s hat.
For petasus cf. Pseud. 2. 4. 45, Etiam opust chlamyde ec
machaera et petaso; caus—ia (Mil. 4. 4. 42; Pers. 1. 3. 75)
was also a broad-brimmed hat to keep off the sun, from καίω.

144. torulus: probably ‘a tasselss θύσανος, hanging under
Jupiter’s hat. Varro, L. L. 5. 157 has—‘l'orulus .· in, mulieris
capite comatam. This would probably mean the ball of made-up
hair at the back of the head. Toras seems to have meant
originally a cord, or a strand in a rope. Cato, B. R. 135,
(funis) tres habeat toros. Colum. 11. 3. 6, tori funiculorum.
Hence torus came to be applied to muscles, which resemble
ropes.

148. N either illic here, making its first syllable short, not
in accordance with Plautus's special rules, nor iilic in 149, a
spondaic word in the second foot, are Plautine: but perhaps
it is rash to alter them, occurring as they do in a Prologue.
For Plautus's rule, see on omnz'buS, vs. 55 supra.

149. lanterna or laterna from λαμπτὴρ, a lantern, here made
of horn, infra 1. 1. 187.

152. facere histrioniam z see on 90 supra.

Aer Ι. 1.

Scene, before the house of Amphitruo, at Thebes. Time,
night. Enter Sosia, on his way from the harbour with a
message to Alcumena from Amphitruo, who has just returned
from the conquest of the Teleboae. Sosia is evidently in a
state of terror, and relieves his sear partly by reciting partly
by singing the reflections that come into his mind on the
situation. The variety of his metres reflects the alarm he
feels. He reminds us of Sir Hugh Evans singing ‘⁶ By shallow
rivers, to whose falls melodious birds sing madrigals,⁷' and
immediately adding “ Mercy on me, I have great dispositions
to ery.'' He finds Mercury, who has assumed his own sorni,
keeping guard in front of the house, and is driven away by
him.
