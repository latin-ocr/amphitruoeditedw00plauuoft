Of the emendations which have been proposed I should
prefer Ribbeck's liberet, which occurred independently to my-
self ε ‘ my father has taken care to deliver her by one birth?
But Ι do not think any emendation necessary.

I have proposed seret et forficret: but, though a verbseo,
whence come fetus, femina, etc., may well have existed, l
have not been able to find a clear instance of prosodiam!
shortening of -et in the imperfect subjunctive in Plautus.

3. 1. 12; with accusative, 3. 2. 15; absolutely, 1. 1. 20.

vates tuus, et sibi parcet ; Sat. l. 4. 127, avidos vicinum fimas
