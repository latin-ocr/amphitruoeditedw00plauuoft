is legitimate in Plautine anapaests. LG bracket the verse:
Leo despairs of the metre, as he does not accent it, and
records LG's expulsion of it with apparent approvaL—

by Spengel. LG accept Hermann's arrangement of 12
opulento homini dura hoc maqz's servitus est as a tetr. bacch,
expelling 13 as a gloss with Gulielmius. Leo omits divit-is
servos, writes misera-st, and seems to scan opulento...miserem

the Ionici. LG quite unreasonably condemn the verse, and
Leo changes Ipse to ipsus to suit his erroneous theory—17. So
