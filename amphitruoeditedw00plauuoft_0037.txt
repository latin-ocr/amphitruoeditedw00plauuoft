JNTROD U ΟΤΙ ON. xxxi

words and combinations of words, and iambic words
were treated as pyrrhics for the purpose of scansion——
(1) in trochaic verse, where the metrica] accent retracted

the quantity. Most. Ι1. 3. 105 :
Nova pictura interpolare vis opus lepidissumum.

(2) in iambic verse where the metrica] accent pulled
forward the quantity. Poen. l. 3. 7 :

Dedi dudum, prius quam me evocavisti foras.

These and other licenses were much more common
at the beginning of the verse than elsewhere, for the
very simple reason that the speaker took fresh breath
there; next to the beginning of the verse, the fifth
foot in septenarii has most instances of such license,
for a similar reason that the speaker paused there
also, though to a less extent.

This principle was extended to two mono-
syllables forming together an iambus. When a
monosyllable is preceded by a short accented mono—
syllable, the second monosyllable may be shortened
in spite of its position, so that in trochaic verse an
amphibrach becomes a tribrach, as Amph. 3. 3. 9 ε

An id ioco dixti? equidem dictum serio ac vero ratus3
1. l. 274 :
Quid in tabernaclo fecisti? victus sum, si dixeris 3

a bacchius an anapaest, as Bacch. 1. 1. 17 :

Quid in consilio consuluistis. Bene. Pol haud meretriciumst3
