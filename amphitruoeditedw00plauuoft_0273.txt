sc. 11. NOTES (777-793). 211

common phrase cette dextra& nunc iam, always trisyllabic in
Plautus, though whether it is derived from nunc iam, or merely
a lengthened form of nunc, as etiam may be of ct, and
whether it is to be written as one word or two, I leave to
philologers to decide.

150. praestrigiatrix, ‘ witch‚’ ‘ sorceress.’ Praestrigyiator
occurs Aul. 4. 4. 3, ete. ; praestiqiac, ‘cheating,' Capt. 3. 3. 9.
The Plautine MSS. vary between praesti- and praestri- (the
Ambrosian gives praescri„ Pocn. 5. 3. 6, 'l'rztc. l. 2. 32). The
spelling praestri- is now generally preferred. The derivation
is uncertain ; it is generally connected with praescr-inflare, ‘ to
dazzle,’ hence ‘to bewitch.' Possibly it may be connected
with striae, ‘ the vampire,' the familiar of witches. Cf.
Propert. 4. 5. 17, Consuluitque striqes: nostro de sanquine. The
first syllable in scrisse& is long, Pseud. 3. 2. 31, Non condimentis
condiunt sed είνῖῃὶὂαε, though it is short in Propertius and
Ovid. The derivation from praestrinqo was, however, clearly
present to Caecilius when he wrote (209 Ribb.) ita omncs meos
dolos fallacias Prae-str2·9ias prae-strinxit commoditas patris.

154. omneS, nominative; congeminavimus, ‘we have all
doubledss Conycminavz‘mns is practically intransitive, but it
may be better to write the line thus :-—

Nunc si patera pateram pariet, omnes congeminabimur.

And thgs seems right, for what is the force of the perfect
e erzt.
p Ζ1755. postulat, ‘ wants ' ; ἀξιοῖ, ‘ makes it her aim.'

156. Unde haec igitur est, nisi abs te quae mihi dono
datast ¹? ‘ From whence came this, unless (it be) the one that
you gave me?' I think the construction, which is slightly
irregular, but perfectly legitimate and intelligible, has been
misunderstood. See Crit. Note.

159. Opus mist istuc exquisito, 1. 3. 7 supra.
160. Quid tibist, 2. 2. 37 supra.

Epid. 1. 1. 19, Quid tibi vis dicam, nisi quod est; Hor. Sat. l.
6. 60, sed, quod crat, narro, according to the reading of some
MSS. In Ter. Her. 5. 3. 3, V {snm est. Certen? Certe. Deme
