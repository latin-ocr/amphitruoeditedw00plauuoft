236 AMPHITRVO. ACT v, ¹ ι

23. Iambic octonarian according to the reading in the text,
allowing hiatus with Amphitruo, as in 2. 2. 194 supra, vs,
28 infra. hic quidem: hic before quidem is short: see 1. 1.
263 supra. Other arrangements of the latter clause are :·--

(1) Goetz following Kiessling :
Amphitruo hic est quidem erus meus.

(2) Ussing following Fleckeisen:
Est Amphitruo hic quidem erus meus.

Against this, at first: sight the best arrangement, is Luchs’s
ἶὲἓῖἔάὲξῖᾑ hic is invariably short when 11, precedes quidem =
(3) Amphibruost hiqujdem meus erus (Brix) ;
(4) Atque Amphitruo hiquidemsb erus meus ;
or’(5) Atque hiquidem Amphitruost erus meus (Luchs).

These 11νὲ scansions make the clause iambic. Spengel scans
it as troc aic 2—-

(6) Amphitruo hic quidemst erus meus. .

25. 'I'ua Bromia ancilla. Brix and Ussing point out that
this was the usual order. They compare meus Mnesilochus
filius, Bacch.. 342, 823; tuum Stalaymum servom, Gapt. 868;
Cas. 711, nostro Olympioni- z·2'lz'eo,· Cisc. 374, mei Lampadisci
servi ; Poen. 170, tuos Collabz‘scus vilicus ; Cic. Cluent. 8.
25, cius Luciam filz'am; Arch. 3. 6, eiu-s Pio fili0; Brut.
26. 98, cuins Caio filio. Bromia. The ancients gave very
fanciful names to their housemaids. thether Bromia is
directly derived from βρέμω, and denobes that the owner of
the name was generally a bustling‚ noisy creature, or made a
great fuss on this particular occasion, or derived from Βρόμιος,
0110 of the names of Bacchus, and denoted her vinose pro-
clivities, is impossible to say.

27. impulit, ‘smote us.'

28. Amphitruo. There is hiatus after Amphitruo here, as
2. 2. 194, 5. 1. 23 supra.

29. sartam mentem, ‘ a whole mind.' Sarius, from sarcio,
meant ‘repaired,’ ‘in a state of repair'3 hence the phrase
sarta tecta εκίῃενε, to see ‘chat all edifices are in a state of
repair, and properly roosed, which was the business of the
aediles. We talk in English of a person ‘having a slate off '
