But mirum quin is invariably used sarcastically of a thing
which is represented to be perfectly impossible3 Most. 2. 2. 62-

TR. Ait illum hoc pacto sibi dixisse mortuom.
ΤΗ. In somnis? ΤΒ. Mirum quin vigilanti diceret,
Qui abhinc sexaginta annis occisus foret,

where see Sonnenschein's note. It is in this sense Horace has
Sat. 2ὁ 1. 54, mirum Ut neque calce lupus quemquam neque deute
