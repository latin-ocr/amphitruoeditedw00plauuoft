PROL. NOTES (47-55). 135

That it was attempted by most of the early poets only shows
that they were unconscious how unsuitable Greek tragesly
was to a Roman mind. Lucilius, Horace, and Persius
severely criticised Roman tragedy, and derided the public who
admired or pretended to admire it. For all that there was
much lofty simplicity in Roman tragedy, and many fine lines
have been handed down to us from it. If we can judge by
fragments, Ribbeck’s first volume, containing the fragments
of tragedy, is, as a poetical storehouse, vastly richer than the
second, which contains the fragments of comedy.

53. commutavero, almostzcommutabo. The future perf. is
thus frequently used in Plautus. Madvig, followed by
Ussing, Lat. Gram. 340, 4, says it is = statim commutabo. I
doubt the statim, and am rather disposed to agree with Roby,
who says, ξ 1485, that “often in comio poets, and occasionally
in later writers, it is used in principal or simple sentences,
with but little, if any, difference from the simple future,'’
though he discriminates certain shades of usage. If there is
any distinction between the tenses, it is possible that the
ficturum exactum denotes greater certainty, rather than greater
speed. The following are the instances from the comio writers
quoted by Roby: Ter. Heaut. 1. l. 34, Aut consolando aut
consilio aut re iuvero: And. 2. 3. 7, Dictum ac facium invenerit
aliquam causam quam ob rem eiciat oppido ,· Plaut. Asin. 2.
2. 14, Erum in obsidione linquet inimicum animos auxerit ,-
Plaut. Most. 3. 1. 157, huc concessero; Capt. 1. 2. 91, mox
ivero. The usage is not very rare in Cicero. It is really like
t-he Irish ‘ I’ll be after doing so and so) ⁶ I'll be sure to' will
often give its force.

55. omnibus isdem versibus. This line is enough to show
that this part at least of the Prologue is not from the hand
of Plautus. An anapaest must never be divided in Iambic or
Trochaic metre, so that its first syllable, or two first syllableS,
form the last syllable or syllables of a polysyllabic word.
Ritschl, who held, wrongly, that the first syllable of omnis
was sometimes short, independent of position (Prol. p. 132),
might see no difficulty here. But omnis never shortens its
first syllable unless a monosyllable precedes, and unless that
monosyllable, with the first syllable of omnis, makes up the
arsis or thesis of a foot. See C. F. W. Mueller, Plaut. Pros.
pp. 281, 367, 432.
