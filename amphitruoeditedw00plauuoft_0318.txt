256 AMPHJTRVO.

with nothing substantial accompanying it, says he has a pro-
verb, for that is a regular use of verbum in Plautus, which
will express what he thinks. But in the ordinary reading no

⁷ proverb is there, but an awkward and common-place line,

where the proverb ought to come: 9errae yermanae edepol
λῆροι λῆροι meri, which is about as far from the MSS. as a line
can possibly be. The MSS. give for the latter part of the
verse ι

haedecol lyrae lyrae,

that is to say, without the alteration of a letter : gyerrae yer-
manae .· αἱ δὲ κολλῦραι λύραι, that is, ‘ loaves are lyres.' ‘Give
me the loaf: I can do without the fiattery.' Does edepol
occur so seldom in Plautus that the scribes of the Palatine
Mss. were puzzled by it and changed it to haedecol ? If so,
what idea did they attach to this remarkable word that they
unanimously substituted for it? The assonance of κολλῦραι
With λύραι is characteristic of proverbs, as sor instance, in the
French proverbs: “ songes mensonges,’' “ qui terre a,

guresffi} areading is, I am pleased to see, adopted by Ussing.
In the edition of the Poenulus by Messrs. Goetz and Loewe,
1884, after this conjecture was published, the line is given

from Ritschl's MS. notes :
Gerrae germanae hercle et collyrae escariae,

which the reader is at liberty to adopt if he chooses.

Psmmoms, l. 3. 117 .
Quid ais quantum terra tegit *ho'minum periurissime?

For teylt, which is the reading of the Palatine Mss.‚ A is said
to have tetiyz't. Hence Goetz reads terram tetigyit ; but though
this might suit a man let down from the clouds by a golden

always blunder in tetulit, the archaic perfect offero (see
Amph. 2. 2. 101, 168), and terra tetulit is, beyond the shadow
of a doubt, the true reading here. Cf. Hor. Sal. 1. 5. 41,
animae, qualis neque candidiores Terra tulit. Id. 2. 2. 92,
Hos utinam inter Heroas natum tellus me prima tulisset.
