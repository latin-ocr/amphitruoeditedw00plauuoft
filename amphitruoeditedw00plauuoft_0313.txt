APPENDIX II. 251

ever shortened in Plautus. There are only two passages,
save in Arguments and Prologues, where it is short. This
passage is one of thern. It should read thus:

foribus dat, aquam bibant.

For the omission of ut see note on Amph. Prol. 12.
The other rebellious passage is Rud. 4. 4. 28:

Verba dat : hoc modo res gestast, ut ego dico. Quid tu ais?

CURCULIO, 5. 2. 3 seqq.

PHAED. Teneo: quid negotist? PLAN. Rogita, unde istunc

We should read, Ι think, Pater avo: is rusum tibi .· ‘ My
mother lent it to my father,' says Planesium. Curculio
ironically retorts: ‘ and your father lent it to your grand-
father3 he in his turn passed it on to you.' To which non-
sensical speech Planesium naturally replies, Nugyas [larris.

EPIDICUS‚ 5. 1. 21.

Editors have tried to get too much out of these lines. There
is nothing more iu them than a sarcastic statement that the
winged-footed Mercury would have come faster than the
