106 AMPHITR VO. [Frg. I.-II.

FRAG. I.

(AMPH.) At ego certo cruce et cruciatum mactabo
exuo mastigia.†

W Μ 11.

(MERG.) Erus Amphitruost occupatus,

Amphitruo and Jupiter mutually accuse each other of being
a seducer : the greater portion of the scene in which Blepharo
is appealed to as an arbiter to decide which is really Am-
phitruo. The gap must have included three or four leaves of
the archetype at least. Nineteen fragments, most, if not all, ¹
certainly belonging to this part of the play, sixteen of them
being from citations of Nonius, have been collected by editors.
These are here given in what seems to me the most likely
order, an order differing somewhat both from that of LG and
of Leo, whose order is referred to in the note. The fragments
are grouped in four divisions, corresponding to the soenes
supposed to be missing.

ΕΒ. l. <1 LG, Leo.) Nonius, p. 342 : mactare malo afficere:
Plautus Amphitryone : ‘ At ego certo cruce et cruciatum mac-
tabo exuo mastigia.' Pylades added te, and corrected cruciatu.
Ussing rightly strikes out certo. exuo is very difficult to
explain : in my opinion Nonius has given us a mixture of two
lines, which it would be presumptuous to restore : Ι will
merely hint that they may have been something of this sort:

At ego te cruce et cruciatu mactabo mox, Sosia.
Faciam ut prae dolore sanquinem exuomas mastigia.

I have at least accounted for exuo, which may well have been
the first part of exvomas, the last syllable of which—mas—

was lost before mastigyia.
