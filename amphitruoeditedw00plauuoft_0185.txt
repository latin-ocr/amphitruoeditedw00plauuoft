ARG. 1. NOTES. 1 25

Romans seem to have written ἰι for υ, though u (long) was in
the best age reserved to represent ου. Fleckeisen invariably
writes Araurippus, sucophanta, eim-annus and the like z but Ι
am not aware that our Mss. in any instance support these
s ellin s.

pGoet‘} has classified the spellings iu our MSS. of the name
Amphitruo through the play. The result is that D gives ·itrio
68 times, never -ytrio ; B -icrio 66 times, 5 times -ytrio 3 that E
and J nearly reverse these proportions in favour of -ytrio ,· but
no MS. gives any instance of a form ending in -crya The tes-
timony of the MSS. of Nonius is rather in favour of Amfitryo
according to Mueller.

2. dum gereret: cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 5, dum conderet
urbem: Geory. 4. 457, dum te sufferet per flumina praeceps:
Aen. 10. 800, Dum qem'tor ‘nati parma protectus abiret: Prop.
2. 26. 47, Testis Amymone latices dum ferret in arvi-s (so N).
All these however convey a sense of struggle or effort on the
part of the subject towards a certain object, and yereret here
sounds distinctly unclassical. Telebois ε it is uncertain where
Plautus conceived the Teleboae to be. His notions of geo-
graphy were not very exact. According to Strabo, 10. 2. 4,
they were considered the same as the Taphians and Cephal-
lenians‚ inhabitants of islands off the coast of Acarnania.
The Taphii are called φιλήρετμοι and ληίστορες in the Oclyssey
1. 181; 15. 4273 and we find that this play represents
Amphitruo as having returned by sea from his conquest.
See Note on ex portu Persico, l. 1. 250.

The conquest of the Teleboae by Amphitruo is mentioned
by Herodotus 5. 59, who tells us that he himself saw at
Thebes a tripod which had in Cadmean letters the following
inscription:

Ἀμφιτρύων μ’ ἀνέθηκε νέων ἀπὸ Τηλεβοάων.
and by Pindar‚ Nem. 10, 24,

θρέψε δἀἰχμὰν Ἀμφιτρύωνος· ὁ δ’ ὄλβῳ φέρτατος

ἵκετ’ ἐς κείνου ’γενεάν ἐπεὶ ἐν χαλκέοις ὅπλοις

Τηλεβόας ἔναρεν· τῷ δ’ ὄψιν ἐειδόμενος ἀθανάτων βασιλεὺς αὐλὰν
ἐσῆλθεν

σπέρμ’ ἀδείμαντον φέρων Ἡρακλέος.

3. Alcmenam: Alcumena is the only form in the play. It was
customary to insert u between c and m in names taken from
