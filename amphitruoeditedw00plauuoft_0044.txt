xxxviii AMPHITRVO.

foot, except the last, which must be 3 pure iambus.
It also occasionally admits a proceleusmaticus,1 espe-
cially at the beginning of the verse.

The penthemimeral caesura being usual, it follows
that the second. foot rarely consists of a word. If it
does, it should never be a spondee, rarely an anapaest,
in which case a monosyllable usually follows ε 500 note
on 3. 2. 43: nor should the third foot ever be an ana-
paestic word.2

2. An iambic trimeter or tetrameter must not end
in two iambic words, or an iambic word, with an
iambus preceding. There is no objection to the line
ending with two iambi, provided the last word is 3
polysyllable, or if the second last word is a fourth
paeon or an anapaest. Thus there is no obJ'ection to
such endings as solus ambulem, molestiam, viduior mayis,
animum tuum. But such endings as boni viri, improbis
ciris are quite impossible. This law applies to the end
of trochaic tetrameters also, and to the end of the first
half of iambic tetrameters, whether catalectic or acata-

lA large number of these so-called proceleusmaqici were
doubtless to Plautus's ear trisyllabic feet, owing to synec-
phonesis. Ennius begins 3 hexameter with capitibus ; yet no
one would say that Ennius admitted. the proceleusmaticus in

1115 hexameters.

² The student, of course, must carefully distin guish between
anapaests and anapaestic words, iambi and iambic words.
