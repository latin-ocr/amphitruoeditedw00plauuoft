118. hac noem, ‘to-night,' also often ‘last night.’ There
is no other trace 01 the old declension from which noctu seems
to be derived. The line Hac noctu filo pendebit Etruria tota is
cited by Macrobius l. 4. 18 from Ennius. On the other hand
noa: was used as an adv. meaning ‘ at night’ or ‘all night’:
As. 3. 3. 7, nox, si voles, manebo. Nocturnum: this is tho
only classical passage where this proper name, ‘the god 01
the night‚' occurs. It is found in Inscriptions, see Crit. Note.

119. Septentriones ‘The Seven Stars.’ Ι think septen-
trio meant merely ‘the seven'; that -trio is only a termina-
tion; and that the ancients were mistaken in supposing
trione-s was a noun meaning ‘ploughers,' derived by Varro,
L. L. 7. 74, from terra, or tero, or tre'90n; by modern philol-
ogersj⁶ from tero. Tero does not mean ‘to plough‚' and triones
could not be formed from it. The six sides of a die were
called unio, binio, trio, quatrio, qninquio, senio, Isid. Or. IS.
·65. Septentrio was formed on a false analogy with trio and
quatrio. The seven stars in the head and back 01 the Great
Bear are meant. Owing to the plural form, which grew up
naturally owing to the proximity of septem, and the incorrect
meaning attached, triones became separated from septem, and
the name came to be incorrectly extended to both Bears. See
Cicero Nat. Deor. 2. 41. 105, Helice, cuius clarissimas stellas
totis noctibus cernimus, Quas nostri septem soliti vocitare triones
Virg. Aen. l. 744, [semino-sque triones The derivation now
proposed explains, and is the only possible explanation 01, the
fact that the form septentrio, ‘ the septet,' was in use as well
as septentriones ; for though Selrrtentrz'ones may naturally have
grown out 01 septentrio, it is impossible that septentrio could
have arisen out 01 septem triones.

'aliave been an old word meaning a star, connected with the root of stella.
