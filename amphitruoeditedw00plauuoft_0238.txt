176 AMPHITRVO. Acr 1.

16. seditio is used of jars between husband and wife,
tending to their separation. Ter. Andr. 5. 1. 11, Filiam ut
darem in seditionem atque incerta-3 nuptias. Cicero says of
Clodia, ad Act. 2. 15, ea est enim seditiosa, ea cum viro bellum
9erz't, which, as Tyrrell has pointed out, is clearly a line from
some dramatic poet. I would insert suo, making it a trochaic :

Ea est enim seditiosa, ea cum [suo] viro bellum gerit.

tradicts the play, which apparently represents the birth of the
twins to have taken place the same day as Amphitruo arrived
from foreign parts.

25. ‘My' father has provided that it should be brought
about by one parturition, that‚' etc. The sentence uno ut
labore absolvat is the subject of fieret.

26. absolvat. In ordinary writing an imperfect would be
expected, but in Plautus a present subjunctive generally
follows a past tense when the action is future. The follow-
ing are some of the more remarkable consecutions of moods in
the comio writers, some of which throw light on the construc-
tion of this passage: Pseud. 3. 2. 6, quin ob eam rem Orcus
reci-pere ad se noluit ut esset hic qui mortuis cenam coquam Ter.
Ad. 3. 2. 18, Sublimem >medium arriperem et capite pronum in
terram statuerem U t cerebro dispergat viam. These passages.
With that before us seem to show that the continuatim. os α
consequence may be in the present subjunctive, the consequence
itself having been in the imperfect. Other striking consecu—
tions are Bacch. 4. 4. 38, eqo patrem exoravi. lVempe erqo hoc
ut faceret, quod loquor? Immo tibi ne noceat 3 (Ji-st. 3. 1. 5, Hic

dedit parentes ut te cog-noscantfacilius; Bacch-‚za 3. 118, ita
feci ut aurum quantum, vellet sumeret, Quantum autem lubeat
reddere uc reddat patri. I leave the reader to adopt the most
plausible theory for the consecution in these and other cases
given by Rothe in his Quae-st. Gramm. p. 2 seqq, merely re-
marking that these passages teach us to be slow to alter con-
secutions testified by the MSS. The imperfect fieret is the
natural tense after curavit, the attention being called to the
act that Jupiter had wffled a certain thing: the present is
