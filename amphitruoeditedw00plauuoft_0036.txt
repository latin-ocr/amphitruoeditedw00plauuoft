Influence Of Accent. There are two sorts of
accent :—- Verbal accent, or the accent which each
word had in ordinary pronunciation; mebrical acuent,
or the accent given by the metrical ictus to a
syllable. Verbal accent never fell in Latin on the
last syllable. Hence there was always a tendency in
Latin to shorten final syllables. This was felt most
in iambic words, the last syllable being shortened by
a principle of compensation for the weight laid in
pronunciation on the first syllable. Hence impera-
tives like abi, redi, mane, roqcz, puta, vola, ama, became
pyrrhics in ordinary conversation, and are regularly
employed as pyrrhics in Latin comedy. Most
commonly they naturally form the beginning of an
anapaest or tribrach‚ but are often found even as the
two last syllables of a dactyl, when the metrica-l
accent would not affect the scansion. Amph. 2. 2.
