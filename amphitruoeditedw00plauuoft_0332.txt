ADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA.

Prol. 17. Professor Sonnenschein remarks on venio—-
venerim that in early Latin the distinction between the co-
ordinate question (parataxis) and the subordinate question
(hypotaxis) had not been evolved.

38. animum quae loquor advortite. ea only, not ad
ca, as I have inadvertently stated, is omitted. The con-
struction of animum advortere with an accusative is
Plautine, as the same construction of animadvertere is, of
course, quite classical.

45. architectus (architecton). Professor Sonnenschein calls
attention to Πλούτων as a parallel form to Πλοῦτος, Ar. Plut.

727.

104. For pater meus read meus pater with Bothe and
Fleckeisen. The latter is the usual order, and the scansion
is simplified by adopting it here.

1. 1. 102. ad. nos is for purposes of scansion one word.
This line therefore is no exception to the rule that the fourth
foot of an iambic septenarius or octonarius must be an
iambus, when the fourth foot ends with a word.

1. 1. 121. Critical Note. DeZe “orfulynrz‘tas.''

1. 1. 129. invitavit. The only passage in Plautus where
invitare has not this meaning is Trin. l. 1. 5 ε

Invitus, ni me invitet ut faciat fides.

1. 1. 139. meticulosus, The mss. here and Aliost. 5. 1. 52
seem to point to metuculosus, which LG adopt here, and
Sonnenschein illest. 1. c. B has here meta culo-sus, D metu-

culosus, and in Most. 1. c. DC2h3ve the u form.
