inductu to the common ductu. ductu is more general, inductu
is ‘leading into fight,’ ‘leading on.’ Cf. inducere, l. 1. 87.

25. coetu, ‘ engagement‚' the only passage where it is used
in this sense. Cf. concurritur, Hor. Sat. l. 1. 7, and our
‘joining battle.' Cf. Ter. Phorm. 2. 2. 32, Prima coitio-sl

acerruma.

26. certe enim, ‘ yes, I know for certain.’ Enim in old Latin
often had an affirmative force, something like nempe, with
which enim is etymologically connected. The illative force is
latent, but it is going too far, in my opinion, to deny the
existence of this illative or causal force in Plautus. Instances
of the affirmative use are Plaut. Most. 3. l. 24, Quid tuce
tecum? TRA. Nihil enim (‘why, nothing’); Cas. 2. 5. 15,
Quid tu postea? OL. Nessea-2· enim ipsi nze concessurum Iovi.
Ussing quotes Ter. Eun. 1074, Et lubenter rivis et enzm bene
lubenter victitas, ‘ yes and ’ ; Virg. Aen. 84, Quam pius Aeneas
tibi, enim tibi, maxima Iuno, illactat, ‘to thee, yes to thee ’ς
Aen. 10. 874, Aeneas agnovit enim laetusque precatur. Cf.
Geory. 2. 509, plausus, per cuneos gyeminatus enim, ‘aye, applause
redoubled.' See Tyrrell's Note on Mil. 4. 6. 6 ; Brix on Trin.
3. 2. 79: it is especially used in the phrases at enim, quia enim,
non enim, nihil enim, certe enim, enim vero, enim iam. It is,
as Brix remarks, often used at the opening of a speech, hence
it is called a particula inceptiva by Donatus on Ter. Ad. 2. 1.
14. expectatum: expectatum advenire (ποθεινὸς ἐλθεῖν).
Pacuvius, 232 (Ribb.) :—

Caelitum camilla, expectata advenis : salve hospita.

optato expands the idea of expectatum .· this superfluity is a
Plautine characteristic. illi: so amicae in next verse and
uxori in 22. The dative after the past participle is not very
common. In these instanoes there is an admixture of the
ethica] dative with the dative of the agent. I mean the con-
struction is between, ‘ I will return expected by my wife,' and
‘ Ι will return expected to the delight of my wife.’

28. hic quidem, to be pronounced, perhaps written,
hiquidem, l. l. 263. ime. The MSS. give ille, but the trochaic
division of a dactyl, {lle re, is not legitimate except at the be-
ginning-of a verse, while it is not usual in Plautus to make ille
