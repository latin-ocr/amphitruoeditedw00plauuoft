60. quam dudum, ‘ how long ago.’ Ussing quotes Trin. 3.

in return? ' The best construction of censere is with ut.
There should be a question stop at abieris. deliramenta,
‘ravings’ Cf. Men. 5. 5. 21, and 2. 2. 96 supra.

65. dum edormiscat unum somnum, ‘ till she sleeps just one
sleep.' Unum is used to justify paulisper. The general use
of edormi-scere, edormire, is not to sleep out a sleep, but to sleep
