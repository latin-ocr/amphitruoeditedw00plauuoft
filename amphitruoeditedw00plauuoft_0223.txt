163. interpolabit, ‘will patch me up.' This word originally
probably meant to fill defects in plaster, in statum-y, or in
painting, by subsequent additions. This agrees with meum·
que os finyet denuo here. It also agrees with Most. 1. 3.
105, where the question Nova pictura interpolare vis opus
lepidissimum is addressed to Philematium, who had asked
for rouge (purpuris-zea), and with Plautus’s use of the adj. in-
terpoles of elderly ladies who try to improve their charnis by
means of cosmetics, Alost. 1. 3. 117, istaec veteres, quae se
unquentis ime-tilam interpolas Vetulae edentulae quae vitia
commrisfuco occulunt. So Pliny uses it of plaster, 35. 16. 56 ;
tectoriormn albaria interpolare. Nonius, however, says it is
derived from the cleaning of old clothes, p. 34, s, v. ab arte
fullonica, qui poliendo diliyeozter vetera quaeque quasi in ‘novam
speciem mutant. In this sense Cic. uses interpolare, Q. Fr.
2. 12. He also uses it of tampering with reem-ds, Verr. 2. 1.
41. The transition to the meaning of ‘spoiling by adding'
is easy, but the literary sense of interpolating passages in an
author does not seem to be Classical. finget: the metaphor is
from the plastic art.

165. exossare: the taking of the back-bone out of the eel is
often referred to. Ter. Ad. 3. 3. 23, Coum-um istum in
aqua sinito ludere .· ubi eyo venero exossabz'tur. Plaut. Pseud.
l. 3. 148, Exossabo ⁶290 illum similiter itidem ut muraenam
coquo-s. The correction exdorsuare gets rid of the hia-tus,
and it is in its favour that at Aul. 2. 9. 2, where the true
reading, Conyrum muraenam exdorsua qucmtum potest, is
preserved in Nonius, the MSS. give exossata fac sient, but
the objection that the play on os is thus lost is fatal to the
proposed change.

166. ultro istunc, ‘away with the man.' Capt. 3. 4. 19,
Ultro istunc a me; Most. 3. 1. 783 Cas. 2. 8. 23.

167. Olet homo quidam, ‘ I smel] somebody.' Cf. Mil. 4.
6. 433 Aristoph. Pax 180, πόθεν βροτοῦ με προσέβαλε [scil.
ὀσμή] malo suo, abl. of accompanying circumstances: ‘to
his hurt.' cum may be omitted when the noun, malo here,
has an epithet. See 212 infra, and 2. 2. 161, note.

168. longe hinc afuit, ‘ he was far from here‚' viz. in the
war with his master, Amphitruo. Why Mercury should be
made to utter this remark I do not see: there is no double
