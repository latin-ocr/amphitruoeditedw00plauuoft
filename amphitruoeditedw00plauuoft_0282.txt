where tlge play is on the adjective ‘ shrewd‚' and the participle
⁴ accuse . '

3. testat clamitat, ‘ protests and tants! The asyndeton is
most strictly Plautine; ProZ. 13 supra. I have no doubt
of the truth of this emendation, which is in fact the reading
of the MSS. ‚ save that it gives tior r, and t for c, both extremely
common exchanges in MSS. testat, for the later testatur, is in
keeping with archaic usage, a striking feature of which is the
large number of verbs used with an active form, which in
later times were only deponent. A very long list of these
verbs will be found in Tyrrell's note to Mil. 2. 2. 17. The
most common of them is perhaps opino, often changed by the
transcribers to opinor. We have in this play contemplo,

l. l. 287 ; tuto, 2. 2. 19; moriyero, 3. 3. 26 ; partio, 4. 3. 1.

5. susque deque esse habituram, ‘ that Ι will think it of no
consequence.’ Cf. Cic. Ate. 14. 6, (Ie Octavio susque deque, in
which judgment Cicero made a very false estimate of character.
Laberius 29 (Ribb.), minc tu lentus, nunc tu susque (leque fers.
The Greek phrase ἄνω καὶ κάτω is not used in this way.

6. perpetiar insimulatam. The construction of patior
with an accusative participle is a good one. Cf. Accius 365
(Ribb.), exulare sinitis, sistis pelli, pulsum patimin& Ine. Fab.
68 (Ribb.)‚ anomz'm'ae se dolore victum nonpotuz't pati; Phorm.
2. 1. 74, eglone illam cum illo ut patiar nuptam unum diem.
Ι have often wondered whether patere could be worked in to
mediate the contending readingS, patet and patere in Hor.

Sat. 2. 2. 29 2——

Carne tamen quamvis distat nil hac magis illa,
Imparibus formis deceptum te patere ἕ Esto.

If we accept Madvig's view that mayis means ‘a dish,' I should
certainly read patere.

7. quin deseram ε this depends on faciam in the previous
verse. “I won't act so as not to desert him '²3 “I most
certainly will desert him.’' Cf. Mil. 2. 3. 12, non enimfacz'am
quin scias ; 1. 1. 244 supra, Tu me vivos hodie numquam
facies quin sim Sosia.

9. nolle esse dicta: so the common phrase nollem sactum,
‘ 1 am sorry for it.’ Ad. 5. 113, nollem huc exitum.

11. si me inam amentem ad sese studeam recipere, ‘ Η I am
