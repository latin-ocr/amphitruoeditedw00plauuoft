but it is sometimes neglected: as

This is not very common 3 but it is usual for the
diaeresis to take place after a preposition, forming
the first part of a compound word.

Bitschl has laid it down that when there is a
dactyl in the fourth foot of a trochaic septenarius,
the regular diaeresis rarely takes place: but instead
a diaeresis after the fourth arsis: Ter. Plzorm. 5. 6.

Pone adprendit pallio resupinat : respicid rogo.

But that is not a real diaeresis. It is better to say
simply that a dactyl is generally allowed1 in the
fourth foot only when there is no diaeresis3 when
the line is in fact scanned as a whole, not as con-
sisting of two parts. A very similar thing occurs,
only more striking, with respect to the diaeresis in
iambic septenarii and octonarii. In these verses the
diaeresis is most strongly marked3 causing, as we
have seen above, the phenomena of hiatus and syllaba
anceps to be regularly allowed after the fourth foot,
that foot being, when it ends with a word, invariably

¹There are, however, many exceptions to this rule.
