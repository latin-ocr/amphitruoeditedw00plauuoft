even in cases where it is difficult without forcing to regard the
perfect as other than aoristic. See note on 1. 2. 26.

42. ut gesserit rempublicam. ‘how he served his country.’
See note on 1. 3. 26.

43. meditabor, rehearse (μελετᾶν, προμελετᾶν). illo = illoc,
illu-c thither.

45. quom pugnabant maxume, ‘when they were in the thick
of fight Ι was in the thick of fiight !’ quom maxime is ‘ at
the very moment when‚⁷ a sense it often bears in the best ages.
But the second mazcmne is not apparently used in this sense,
but simply means, ‘as hard as Ι could,' with a joke on the
other idiom. Cf. 1. l. 273. Sosia's light way of speaking of
his own want of heart for fighting recalls the American parody:
“Farewell, mother, you will never see my name among the
slain.⁷' ego: even if we do not add tum, this passage does not

50. delegit, pres.. as its position shows. In Iambic
septenarii, and Iambic octonarii, whenever the fourth foot

Ter. Phoron.. 3. 2. 47, mile-5 clare se dixit. aliter animati,
exactly our ‘ otherwise minded.'

56. igitur, ‘thereupon'3 igitur generally has a temporal
rather than an illative sense in Plautus. qu'tur tum, iyz'tur
demum are common in Plautus. expugnassere: the archaic
future infinitive z euspuslnaturum esse. So reconcilias-sere, Capt.
l. ἱ). 65; impetrassem, Aul. 4. 7. 6; Mil. 4. 2. 138. If we
suppose the sulm-um exactum to have been originally expua-
, naz-2720, its contraction into expnqmzsso is easy. Brix, Cape. 1.

60. proinde uti, accordingly they bid him (iubent) uti, etc.

63. Teleboae contra: the MSS. have contra Teleboae: as I
have taken the view that contra is more likely to be a trochee
than a spondee, I have accepted the transposition3 though I
have doubts whether I am justified in so doing. See Preface,
eontra.
