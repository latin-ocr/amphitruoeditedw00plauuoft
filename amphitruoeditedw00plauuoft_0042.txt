have a liquid between the two vowels.1 The first
two of these restrictions seem to me unwarranted.
If Ι have made up my mind on any point connected
with Plautine scansion it is this, that in common
words, whether monosyllables, dissyllables, or poly-
syllables‚ syncope is as true a theory of the
cause of the shortening of a syllable long by position
as metrica] accent3 although no doubt the two
principles worked together, as they do in all poetry,
which like Latin or English has a strong accentual
pronunciation. This, however, is a subject for a
separate paper. I would only ask any one to con-
sider all the instances where vel apparently shortens
a following long syllable in Plautus3 the large
number of instances where voluptas, voluntas,

1 He includes among words slurred apud, quidem, bonus
bonum, malos, mali, bene, male, domum, domi, domo, manus,
enim, tamen, senem, simul, fore-3, foras, minas, amor, erum.
Of these Ι should say that domi, domum, domo, enim, quidem,
were often pyrrhics in ordinary pronunciation. Ritschl's view
as to the pronunciation of the remaining words seems to me
most probable3 he expresses his opinion thus strongly:
“ quae quis tam pravo iudicio est ut correptis potius ultimis
syllabis quam pronuntiando elisis primis dicta esse con·
tendat? '' but his words of cantion are also worth repeating:
“verum difficile est et lubricum, quid vitae consuetudo
veterum probare vel potuerit vel non potuerit, assequi
ratiocinando et comminiscendo velle.'' Ritschl even extends
his theory to sine, and I believe he is right. Ι would extend

it even to per and vel.
