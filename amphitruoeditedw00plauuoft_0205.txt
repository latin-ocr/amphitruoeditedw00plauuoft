sc. ι. NOTES (153-168). 143

canticum, vs. 23 is best scanned as Ionio. In Truc. 2. 5. 1
(448, Schoell), a bacchiac canticum is introduc-ed by the line:

Puero isti date mammam,

which, though capable of scansion as two bacchii, is really two
Ionics a minore, and so in other passages.

11. idem hoc, ‘ on this same errand': ad hoc, ob hoc. The
idiom is not unlike the use 01 ταῦτα, τοῦτο, for διὰ ταῦτα, διὰ
τοῦτο. See note on 3. 2. 28 infra, Et id huc revorti. luci, or
lucei, an old locative, ‘by daylight ἐ cf. mani, noctu, vesperi,
temperi.

12. servitiis. I have accepted Spengel's scansion 01 these
three verses as anapaestic dimeters. In Plautine anapaestic
verse, esp. in octonarii, syllables long by position and nature
were often shortened, owing to the influence 01 the accent.
The shortening 01 hoc in vs. 11 has many parallels even in
Iambic and Trochaic verses, following an accented mono-
syllable, or, which is the same thing 101· this purpose, a
monosyllable by elision. Cf. 101· instance vss. 293, 310,
444, 459, 742 01 Sonnenschein's Captivi. For the shortening
of the last syllable 01 servitus in anapaestic metre, cf. the
long list given by Spengel, Reform. p. 314. Among these
is Cure. 1. 2. 53:

Quae tuo gutturi sit monumentum,

which is sufficient to illustrate sercitffcs here. See on 5. 1. 10.
servituis is here strictly a verbal noun and takes a dative as
sermo oes.

14. noctesque diesque assiduo satis superquest. This is a
normal Sotadean consisting 01 two Ionics a maiore followed by
three trochees. For this metre see W. Christ, M etrilc, p. 489.
The only variations from the normal form which these five
lines present are that in vs. 15 there is contraction 01 the-two
last syllables 01 the first Ionio a maiore and substitution of a
ditrocheus sor the second : quo facto aut Ι dicto acle-st ο- ,· in vs.
16 there is resolution 01 the second syllable 01 both Ionios a
maiore, Ipse dommus, clives operis.

This metre is very rare in Latin as 111 Greek. Varro
occasionally employed it. From his Aborigyines, a Menippean
satire, are cited (1-3 Riese) :
