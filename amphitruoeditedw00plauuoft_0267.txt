sc. 11. NOTES (mi-740). 205

40, Praetor yram: morbo impla-itus. The vulgate tibi sensisti
impliciscier is not tolerable. Ussing says it means ‘ that your
bile began to be disordered,’ but if bilem is understood from
the previous verse, atram must be understood also, and that
would make nonsense3 secondly, impliciscier does not mean
to begin to be disordered, or anything like it. Implicz‘sci is the
inceptive of implicari. It occurs nowhere else in really
classical Latin, but Fronto ad Μ. Cae-s. 13, quotes a passage
from an old poet which contains the word, but the passage
is a very obscure and corrupt one.

100. hac noctu, 1. 1. 250 supra. qui sumus, a free construc-
tion, κατὰ σύνεσιν. ’

101. tetuli pedem, 2. 2. 84 supra. Cf. Catull. 14. 22, Vos
huc interea valete, abite, Illuc, unde malum pedem tulistis ,··
Most. 2. 2. 39, in hasce aedes pedem Α’ρφηο intro tetulit semel
ut emiyravimus ,· illem. 2. 3. 30, in hanc arbem pedem Nisi hodie,
numquam intro tetulit ; Ter. And. 4. 5. 13, numquam leuc
tetulissem pedem. Surely these parallels establish tetulit
here if parallels can establish anything 3 yet LG, Ussing, and
Leo keep intuli. ut, postquamf since‚’ a sense ut often bears
in Plautus, Most. 2. 2. 40. etiam, ‘yet.' Cf. As. 2. 4. 38,
Scyphos quos utendos dedi, Philodamo ren-alitae :⁹ LIB. AVon
etiam. Pers. 4. 4. 78, Nihil adhuc peccavit etiam.

102. Quid est, 2. 1. 6 supra.

106. ut commeminit, ‘to the best of her recollection.’
prodigiali Jovi‚ ‘to Jove, god of prodigies.' In Greek,
ἀποτροπαίῳ, ‘the averter,' would probably be used3 but
ἀποτρόπαιος is generally applied to Apollo, as Ar. Av. 61,
’Ἀπολλον ἀποτρόπαιε τοῦ χασμήματος,; averruncus. Ussing
remarks that Jupiter Depul-sor, as the averter of prodigies, is
mentioned in Inscriptions, Orelli, Iuscr. 1230, 5621. He
cites τεράστιος from Lucian, Tim. 41.

108. conprecatam opportuit. Ussing remarks that esse is
invariably omitted. Langen corrects him, p. 54, quoting
Trin. 1092, Most. 1093, Bacch. 819, Cas. 4. l. 83 but neither
Ussing nor Langen notices that in all the passages they quote
the verb is passive. The constructions of oportuit in Plautus
are (l) with infinitive present or past, as Aul. 2. 2. 3, quem
dividere amentum oportuit ‚· Amph. 3. 2. 63, Primum cavisse
oportuit ne diceres. To this class belongs comprecatam (esse)
