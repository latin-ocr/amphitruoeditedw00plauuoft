128 Α M PH I ΤΗ VO. PROL.

Plautina longa fabula in scaenam venit.

But the most express and important testimony is that
furnished by the Prologue to the Casina, 5 sqq. .·

Qui utuntur vino vetere sapientes puto

Et qui libenter veteres spectant fabulas.
Nam, nunc novae quae prodeunt comoediae
Multo sunt nequiores quam nummi novi.
Nos postquam populi rumorem intelleximus,
Studiose expetere vos Plautinas fabulas,
Antiquam eius edimus comoediam

Quam vos probastis qui estis in senioribus ε
Nam iuniorum qui sunt non norunt, scio.
Haec quom primum actast vicit omnis fabulas.
Ea tempestate fios poetarum fuit

Qui nunc abierunt hinc in communem locum.

This Prologue tells us almost in express terms that Plautus
was dead: and expressly tells us that the Casina had been
first acted too long ago for the younger men to remember,
though the elder men had seen it. That is to say, the
Prologue was written somewhere about thirty or forty years
after the first representation of the play. In fact it was
written during a Plautine revival which took place somewhere
about the time of the third Punic lVar ε a revival which was
perhaps created by the comedies of Terence. These were too
few in number to satisfy the popular appetite, and perhaps
they were found deficient in the broad humour which the
older men remembered in Plautus, Now any one who reads
the Prologues of the Amphitruo, Casina, Menaechmi, Poenulus,
and Captivi, cannot fail to come to the conclusion that they
are by the same hand. There is, in> all these Prologue& the
same disposition to chat with, and to talk “gag'' to the
audience‚ to take the spectators into confidence‚ and to make
everything obligingly clear to them.

Those five Prologues then, to the Amphitruo (in great part),
to the Menaechmi, Casina, Poenulus, and Captivi, are not by
Plautus, but were written about a generation after his death,
about 150 B.c. The Prologues to the Aulularia, Ruclens,
Trinnmmws, in which a god, to the Trzccnlentzcs‚ in which the
author himself, by the mouth of an actor, briefiy addresses
the audience‚ are probably genuine : possibly too the Prologue
to the Mercator, spoken by Charinus, one of the characters.
