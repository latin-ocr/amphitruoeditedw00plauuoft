Lex Agraria, ibid. p. 194: (le eo a9ro siremps lex esto quaneei
is ayer P. llucio L. Calpurnio cos publicus fuiss-et. Paulus
in Festus, s. τη, derives the word from similis re ipsa. The
last part of the word 1s clearly eampse, the old form of ipsam;
for the first part similis re and sic re have been proposed.
See Wordsworth, Frass. and spec. p. 108. Ι should rather
suppose the first part to be from sei rei=ei rei: cf. sum, sos,
sas for eum, eos, eas in Ennius. Charisius says. p. 153, 32,
Keil, siremps per nominativum et ablativum declinatur abbae
sirempse ,· and he goes on: nisi forte adverbialiter loqui
maluerint similiter lex esto. He seems wrongin not recognising
the accusative.

74. magistratum is trisyllabic: it was doubtless slurred in
ordinary pronunciation, and so was mayister: and the French
maistre, maure, represents the common pronunciation. So
fenestra, minister, were often pronounced as if two syllables.
A better line might be got by writing Quasi si maqistratum sibi
alterive ambi-verint, eliding sibi ,· see on 5. 2. l. Laws de
Ambitu date from a very early period in Roman history:
Livy mentions enactments in 358, 181, 160 Rc. (Ussing).

79. sat habet favitorum semper qui recte facit: a Stoic
ῗὲῃέἐξιὶἓέῖ ; virtue is its own reward: here limited to goodness

80. si 11115 fides est: i. e. if those who have charge of the
matter act fairly: the aediles, above. In manu is a common
Plautine phrase, meaning ‘in one ’s power' ; see note on 2.
1. 14. The limitation of the general maxim of the previous
verse is awkward, and Ι used to think the meaning of the
verse was ‘if we may trust those, who make that subject
their concern,' i. e. ‘ virtue is its own reward if we may trust
the philosophers and moralists.' But Poen. Prol. 51 seq.
clearly proves the aediles to be meant : sin odiost dicam tamen
Si quidem licebit per illos quibus est iu manu.

81. Ι have added is, i.e. ‘ he,’ Jupiter. See Critical Note.
84. i.e. quominus alter placeret: see on Arg. 2. 8.

85. ornamenta et corium conciderent, ‘ cut his dress and his
hide in pieces ’ with the scourge.

90. facere histrioniam, sc. artem, ‘to turn actor.’ So
medicinam facere, ‘to be a surgeon’3 aryentariam facere, ‘to
