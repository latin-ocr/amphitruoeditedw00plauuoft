The foregoing observations‚ although not at all
exhaustive, will probably be found sufficient for the
ordinary student of Plautus. They show that, whereas
to a careless reader the versification of Plautus is apt
to seem capricious and not subject to rule, it is as a
matter of fact extremely artificial, and difficult to
imitate without tripping 3 and the student should also
take notice of the fact that while the licenses of
Plautus are governed by fixed laws, which can be laid
down with more or less certainty, the large majority
of his verses are perfectly free from license of any kind.
Plautus is master of his metre. In his Iambics he is
the equa] of Terence3 in his trochaics he is Vastly
superior to the latter, and indeed has no rival in
Latin. And it was doubtless the ease and fluency of
these metres, J'oined with the unaffected simplicity of
his diction, that won for Plautus the praise of Stilo,
namely, that if the Muses were to choose to speak in
Latin they would speak in the diction of Plautus.1
