214 AMPHJTRVO. . ACT ι.

a. neutral word denoting simply a thing done (facio), as in
Mil. 2. 4. 24, *vimi-3 mirum esc facinus quomodo haec hinc
potuerit, transire, and Eud. 1. 2. 73; and in Cicero even
praeclarum facinus, recti-ssimum facinus occur. quod in-
simulas, ‘ which you accuse me of.' Ivi-simulo sometimes took
two accusatives, person and thing ; cf. infra 227, meo viro sic
me insimulare falso facirms tam malum. So accuso, Trin. 1.
2. 59, Si id me non accusas. nostro generi non decet, ‘be-

comes not my family.' Decet is often joined with a dative in
old authors, see 3. 4. 24.

189. captas, ‘ if you try to catch me in unchastity you will
fail to catch me.’ Captare is joined with a genitive in imita-
tion of accusare, damnare, with genitive.

191. Propemodum, ‘ratheri’ portu Persico, 1. 1. 250
supra.

192. adsentiant: both adsentio and adsentior were used in
the best age. For a full catalogue of deponents used with

active), forms in old Latin see Langen, pp. 59-68. Cf. note on
ι). 2.. . ·

194. We have hiatus of the last syllable of Amphitruo here,
5. 1. 23 and 29. Ι suspect Plautus may have been influenced
by the Greek form Amphitruon in all these passages.

195. tamen, cf. 1. 3. 44 supra. This delicate use of tamen,
referring to an adjective expressed, or thought implied, is
among the niceties of the Latin language. Propertius, 2. 4.
10, Unde tamen veniant tot mala caeca via est, ‘dark is the
path whence so many evils come, yet: they come.' Virg. Aen.
4. 329, Si quis mihi parvulus aula luderet Aeneas qui te tamen
ore referret, ‘though far away.' Virg. ΕΟΖ. 10. 31, Tamen
cantabitis, inquit, Montibus his vestris.

tuam rem curet. Curare is also used with dative in
Plautus, le’l. 2. 6. 2, erili negyotio curat, where see Tyrrell’s
Note. fungatur: junqi always takes accusative in Plautus;
generally in Terence, who only once uses it with ablative,
Ad. 4. 3. 12. utor in Plautus and Terence usually takes abl„
seldom acc. abutor (‘ to use up ²) is joined by both only with
acc. frui takes abl. the onJy time (As. 5. 2. 68) it occurs
in Plautus: in Terence it has accusative once, abl. four times.
Vescor does not seem to have been certainly used by either
