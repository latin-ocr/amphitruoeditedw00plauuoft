258 AMPHITRVO.

Statim, the conjecture of Brix, will not do. Statim (see note
on Amph. 1. 1. 84) never means anything in Plautus but
‘ standing still! I conjecture we should read stlata .· stlata
was a sort of ship. In the glossary of Philoxenus we have
sclam: πειρατικοῦ σκάφους εἶδος. Now this glossary contains
many explanations of Plautine words. It was in this glossat-y
Scaliger found favea : παιδίσκη; whence he restored faveo, in
Mil. 3. 1. 202. And it seems that when the gloss writer
calls stlaca a ‘ piratical sort of vessel ' he very likely had this
passage before him, naturally mistaking latrocinatum to mean
‘ to carry on piracy‚' a meaning it often had in later times.
Its meaning here is ⁴ to take service as a mercenary.’ For the
proposed derivations of stlata see Mayor’s note on stlataria
purpura, J uV. 7. 134. It probably meant a vessel for
trafficking with foreign ports. This conjecture suits critical
laws : for Z and i, c and t are regularly interchanged in MSS.

Smenos, 5. 2. 21.

Volo eluamus hodie peregrina omnia.
Relinque ε Athenas nunc colamus: sequere me.

It is impossible that this passage can be sound. Relinque
must have an accusative: and if we punctuate after hodie,
eluamus in its turn wants au accusative3 and such a phrase
as eluere pereqrina is without parallel. Stichus and Sagarinus‚
slaves, are making cheap preparations for a banquet, as far as
their means will allow them, pro opibus uostris (5. 4. 8). The
commendation of Athens agrees with this, for Attio banquets
were proverbially meagre (Lynceus, ap. Athen. 4. 131. 6).
I propose therefore :

Nolo helluemus hodie ε peregrina omnia
Relinque : Athenas nunc colamus : sequere me.

Helluare would be the naturally Plautine form for helluari:
see note on Amph. 3. 2. 3. The meaning then will be : ‘ I vote
we don’t gormandize to-day: no foreign fashions for us: neat
&tic fare ! ' Η enatemus would ‘be written heluemus ,j the
