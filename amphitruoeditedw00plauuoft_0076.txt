16 A MPHI TRV Ο. [150-152

abigam iam ego illunc advenientem ab aedibus. 150
adeste: erit operae pretium hic spectantibus
Iovem et Mercurium facere histrioniam.

insert huc before advenit with Cam—150. illum M, illunc
Cam„ LG, Lea—151. adest ferit M, an uncial corruption:
corr. Palmerius.—hz'c spectantibus· M, inspectantibus Hermann,
with other changes, Mueller. Fleek. erases pretium and gives
cobis in its place. LG write: Adeste, erit operae pretium:
mmo spectabitis, rather a pretty reading. Leo suggests sic
for hic. The verse as given above with the MSS. must be
scanned as if eric were one syllable, with hiatus after pretium:
the student should beware of scanning erit operae‘ with too
bad aecents.—l52. hic ltistr. H erm., LG. Mueller, Pros.‚ p.
518, proposes facere una or vt faciunt. He notices that the
MSS. exhibit seven instances of hiatus in the last twelve lines

of this Prologu e.
