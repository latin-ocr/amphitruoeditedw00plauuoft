TERMINATIONS.

-a. It is a disputed point whether Plautus ever
lengthened a in the nominative singular of the first
declension. O. F. W. Mueller, Plaut. Pros. p. 1-10,
denies this lengthening altogether, I believe rightly.
Ussing limits it to nominatives of Greek proper names.
In this play we have only two instances presented by
the MSS„ both of the proper name Sosia, 1. 1. 283, 284.
In both passages emendation is easy, and in this
edition this long a does not appear.

iba. According to the MSS. of Plautus the last
syllable of ita, is often long. Mueller, p. 14, has col-
lected the instances, twenty-two in number. Many
of these are only apparent instances: (3.9. Uist.

1.3.3:

ita properavit de puella proloqui,

disappears, when we reflect that the whole speech in
which it occurs is at least a generation later than
Plautus Some instances are from spurious prologues
and arguments 3 others are of easy correction 3 as Asin.
l. 1. 18. λ

Three apparent instances are found in lee Amphitruo:
2. 2. 3: 5. 1. 25: 5. 1. 29. These are all to be
emended, or to be otherwise explained. I do not be-
lieve that Plautus ever lengthened the final syllable
of ita .· see note on 2. 2. 3.

frustra. The last syllable of frustra is short in
Plautus: frustra sis often ends an iambic or trochaic
