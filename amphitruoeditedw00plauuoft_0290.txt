AMPHITEVO. Acr 111ss

Acer III. 4.

Mercury appears in answer ‘co Jupiter's summons, and
announces his intention of taking his stand on the roof and
driving Amphitruo off by drenching him from above.

 

2. ut. There is hiatus ab the end of the first half of the
verse, as in vs. 17, 21 infra. Several short: syllables also are
found in this position. These licenses are freely allowed in
iambic septenarii and octonarii.

3 {Egne adfero: Prol. 32 supra ; Virg. Aen. 3. 310 ; 8. 477;

7. decedere. Abraham requires cle before via, as in vs. 1,
and for this purpose he omits est. De is generally used, and

Abrgham {pay be right. Τνίη. 2. 4. 80, Decedam eqo illi de
νεα e semi a.

8. eius dicto imperio sum audiens, ‘I am obedient to his
hest and will.’ Dicto and imperio are separate datives
governed by audiens. Ussing explains the construction
‘co be, eiu-3 imperio sum dicto audiens, as two lines above,
Eyo sum Iovi dieto audiens. No doubt dicto audiens became
a, formula, practically equivalenb to obediens, governing
another dative, as audiens dieto iussis magistratuum, Nep.
Aqes. 43 Cic. Verr. 2. 5. 32, Syracusani vobis dieto audientes
sunt. But here we have an earlier idiom before dicto and
audiente-s have coalesced into a single idea, and where dicto
is governed by audie7i3; just so imperiis is governed by
audiens, Truc. 123, tibi sertio atque audiens sum imperiis,
and here im] erio is added to dicto without a copula, the
absence of which is characteristic of ancient Latin as we
have seen, especially of ancient formulae, Prol. 133 1. l. 39
supra. A'nd no doubt dicto, imperio audientem esse was the
full phrase of which dieto audientem esse was a shortened
and later form. Plaubus uses dicto audiens for dicto obediem,
Pers. 3. 1. 71, As. 3. 1. 40.

13. modo bono, ‘ with due moderation.’

16. coronam. The garlands worn by banqueters are often
referred to. Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 256, potus ut ille (Polemon) Dicitur
ex collo furtim carpsisse coronas.
