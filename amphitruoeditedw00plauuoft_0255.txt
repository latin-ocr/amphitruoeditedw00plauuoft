SC. ΙΙ. ⁷ NOTES (635-647). 193

5. domo: οἴκοθεν, ‘of myself‚’ a common phrase; domi
habere is ‘ to have about one‚' ‘of one’s own.' The ablativa
is probably right, of the source. domo petes is found in
Cic. Fam. 7. 25: domo quaerendum remedium. Id. cluent.
9. 27. See Tyrrell's note 011 Mil. 2. 2. 39.

7. dudum hinc ante lucem. Cf. vs. 67 infra, Nam dudum
ante lucem et istunc et te vicli ,· 2. 1. 55, Nam ut dudum ante
lucem α portu ‘me praemisisti domum.. Poen. 1. 2. 104, iam
dudum ante lucem ad aedem Veneris veni-mus.

8. abest quem ego. quernis not elided, but shortened before
e, the last syllable of a bacchius being in arsis, as well as the
second, and que‘m ἔ are ε·- the last syllable οἰ the bacchius

resolved.

10. quom. The regular Plautine particle after verbs of
congratulation, praise, and the reverse, Men. 5. 9. 87, Quom tu
es liber, 9audeo, Messenio ,· Capt. 1. 2. 48. Laudo malum quom
amici tuom ducis malum. Ussing quotes Cic. Fam. 9. 14. 3,
gyratulor tibi cum tantum vale-3 ; Id. Mil. 36. 99, Te quidem,
rum isto animo es, sacis laudare ηοη possum. He truly
remarks, however, that as hoc precedes, we might rather
expect quod for quom here ; but he quotes the parallel Bacch.
334, Istuc sapienter saltem fecit filius, Quom diviti homini id
aarum servandum dedit ,· and Ter. Phorm. 967, hoc fretus quom
e medio excessit. So in Greek ὅτε is used, Arist. Ach. 400,
ὦ τρισμακάρι’ Εὐριπίδη ”Οθ’ ὁ δοῦλος οὑτωσὶ σοφῶς ὑποκρίνεται; and
Rau. 20, Blaydes has adopted my change of ὅτι to ὅτε, Ὦ
τρισκακοδαίμων ἆρ’ ὁ τράχηλος οὑτοσί “Ore θλίβεται μὲν τὸ δὲ
γέλοιον οὐκ ἐρεῖ. perduellis: here four syllables, See note
1. 1. 35.

ll. vicit. This termination was originally long, and is re-
peatedly found so in Plautus and Ennius. Brix on Mil. 2. 2.
58 (astitit) quotes many instanees. Even in the Augustan
age many traces of this appear in the willingness of poets
to lengthen, in caesural arsis, the last syllable of a verb
ending in -ί, Thus the only undoubted lengthening in caesural
arsis in Propertius is 4. 1. 17, Nulli cura-fuit externos quaerere
divos. See my Note on Hor. Sat. 1. 9. 21.

14. abitus, ‘his goings away.' Alcumena speaks generally.

15. victor clueat, ‘be hailed conqueror.' Clueo is properly
N
