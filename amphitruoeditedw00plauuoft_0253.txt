in Plautus. The medial syllable was formerly supposed to be
short, and Bothe and SVeise altered all the passages which this
theory did not suit. Kampmann was the first to demonstrate
the true quantity in modern times. So a preconceived
notion caused Bothe to spoil ilsen. 3. 1. 26, Tantas struices
concinnat patinarias, by placing Ec before it. A more glaring
instance still is the view commonly held that dierectus is a
trisyllable, involving numerous and sometimes large altera-
tions of five or six out of thirteen passages, instead of a trivial
alteration of only one, Tria. 2. 4. 56, where hinc should be
omitted. As to the form simitur, proposed by Ritschl, it is
only known from one or two inscriptions, probably centuries
later than Plautus (Orelli 2863, Mommsen Neap. 423), and
there is no trace of simitur in any ancient writer.

Aer II. 2.

Alcumena, in front of her house, laments her supposed hus-
band's departure. To her enter Amphitruo and Sosia. She
is surprised by Amphitruo’s sudden return: he is amazed by her
cold reception‚ and still more by her story. He announces his
intention of divorcing her: but first he determines to seek
out Naucrates, his fellow passenger, a relation of Alcumena,
and confront his wife with his denial of her story.

 

1. Satin z nonne, as often. res voluptatum z voluptates,
a periphrastic expression to which I know no exact parallel
in Latin. It is probably, as Muretus says, a translation of
τὸ χρῆμα τῶν ἡδονῶν. Cf. Arist. Nub. 1, ὣ Ζεῦ βασιλεῦ τὸ
χρῆμα τῶν νυκτῶν ὅσον. Ussing takes parva ‘res = eoeiqzca pars,
‘ what a small share of pleasures there is in life.’

2. praequam, ‘compared with': generally joined with
relatives. Aul. 3. 5. 33, Sed hoc etiam pulerumst praequam
sumptus ubi petunt. Also without relatives, Most. 4. 2. 65,
Nihil Izoc quidemst Triqinta minae praequam alios dapsilis
sumptus facit. Its use is much the same as of praeut, 1. 1. 220
