218 AMPHITRVO. Aer 111.

Aci· III. 1.

Jupiter unfolds the further developments of the play.

 

I suspect that this scene, which might be omitted without
loss, is not genuine. In fact all the ‘ explanatory ’ parts of
the play seem to be late, and by the same hand as the Pro·
logue. If this be so, it is probably rash to try and emend the
metrica] corruptions. For, as I have said before, I cannot
assent to Ritschl’s view that the writers of these parts fully
attained to Plautus’s art. Thus the very difficult question
arises, How far did they succeed in attaining to it, in what
instances fall short of it? In my Critical Notes I have, how·
ever, treated the scene as if it were Plautine.

1. quoiei, archaic for quoi, cui. quoii (or quoiez') “frequenti
in legibus saeculi VII scriptura,'' Ritschl, quoted by Brix on
Trz'n. 2. 2. 77.

2. idem, of change in the same person as usual.

3. superiore cenaculo, ‘in the top attic‚' by way of joke for
the sky. Ennius, Annal. 68 (Mueller), cenacula maxima caeli,
though he probably used the word without any humble
association. But in Juv. 10. 86, rarus venit in. cenacula miles,
the sense of ‘garret' is clear. Varro, L. L. 5. 162, says the
upper part of the house was called cenacula, postquam in
superiore parte cenitare coepe-unt.

5. quom extemplo z simul ac, the moment3 a common
phrase. ilico, ‘straightway.'

8. incohatam transigam comoediam, ‘leave the comedy half
finished'3 literally, ‘bringit toaclose when only begun.' Inco-
hatvufs is thus often used by C1cero : Or. 1. 2, incohata ac rudia;
Off l. 43, coyzzz‘tz'o manca atque incohata ; N. D. 1. 20, erat
autem difficile rem tantam tamque praeclaram incohatam
relinquere, where Mayor says the perfect participle always
has this meaning.

11. contraxerim, ‘the trouble which I have created.’ Cf.
Cas. 3. 2. 31, aliquid contrahere cupio Zitz’gyi inter eos duos.

12. expetat, ‘fall on the head of,' l. 2. 33 supra.
13. memet ut occepi would introduce an impossible ana·
