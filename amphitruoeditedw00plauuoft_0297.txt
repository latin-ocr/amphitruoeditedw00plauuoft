so.1. ⁷ NOTES (1053-1072). 235

student must not be deterred by the shortening of ut before
valide. This shortening of syllables, usually long, is
one of the two peculiarities of Latin comio anapaestie metre ;
the other is the free use of synizesis. See an instance of this
shortening in the Note on 1. 1. 11 supra, where Spengel’s
reading, opulento homini hoc servitus dumet, is adopted. These
two lieenses are the result of the forced aecentuation of ana-
paestic verses.

14. surgite. The thought and inspiration of these fine
trochaies was evidently caught from the Bacchae of Euripides,
which, as we have seen, was imitated by the author before
(1. l. 203 supra), 594 seqq:

βάρβαροι ’γυναῖκες οὕτως ἐκπεπληγμέναι φόβῳ
πρὸς πέδῳ πεπτώκατ’ ; ᾔσθησθ’, ὡς ἔοικε Βακχίου
διατιναξάντος τὰ Πένθεως δώματ’ ἀλλ’ ἀνίστατε
σῶμα καὶ θαρσεῖτε, σαρκὸς ἐξαμειψάσαι τρόμον.

15. ut iacui, ‘having fallen down.' Ut is used just the
same way, 1. 1. 175 supra, Lassus sum hercle e navi, ut vectu-s·
huc sum ,· etiam nunc ncnc-seo, where it is a mistake to translate
ub ‘since' Ut rather means ‘in accordanee with the faet‚’
and so ut iacui, uc vectus sam, are equivalent to participles,
‘having fallen down,' ‘having come here by ship.’ For the

metre see Crit. Note, and for similar numeri continuati see
Bacch. 4. S. 47 (quoted by Ussing, Prol. p. 186) :

Nune alteris etiam ducentis usus est qui dispensentur
Ilio capto ut sit mulsum qui triumphent milites.

16. There is something· awkward in this line, and possibly
the reading is not cleared up. If etsi were read for iam the
verse would run smoothly, but etsi is far from the MSS. Per-
haps the following arrangement would suit :—

Ibi me inclamat Alcumena τ, “ 1 ” Ξ mea res me horrore adficit ε
Erilis praevortit metus.

‘Alcumena calls me, “Come!'' my own concern (zze. the
alarm she was in, owing to the speech of the god, and the
apparently burning house) appals n1e3 (but) my sear of (not
for) my lady gets the better of it.'

20. Trochaie tetram. eat. senex. Amphitruo probably
presented himself to the mind of the author as about the age
of a Roman consul, somewhere about 48 or 50. hic : short, as
nearly always in Plautus. See on 1. 1. 146.
