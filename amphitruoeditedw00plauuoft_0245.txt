so. 111. ’ NOTE'S (529-542>. 183

abire were used of time rapidly passing by; and there being
an omission of the verb after tempus, it may be as properly
filled up by it as by est ε indeed more properly, for tempus est
wants an infinitive expressed. Pers. 4. 7. 14 is no exception τ
Quid, si admonram ,9 VIR. Tempus est, for there an infinitive
is to be supplied out of admoneam. It = eit is long in
Plautus.

36. im -- illic, an alternative form.

38. Facis, ut alias res soles. The gift at once puts Alcu-
mena in a good humour.

39. ecastor, ‘so help me Castor,' a woman's oath. We are
told by Gellius that women never said mehercule nor men
ecastor. Passages where the MSS. put ecastor in the mouth of
a man, as Asin. 5. 2. 9Ο; Cas. 5. 4. 13, have been, or should
be, changed. condignum: always used by Plautus in the
sense of congruens, conveniens .· ‘ a gift which is worthy of the
giver.' He is especially fond of the adverb condique: condi-
9ne te, Cas. l. 433 condique ut mos esi meretricius, ‘quite
in keeping with‚’ Men. 5. 5. 8. Here condi-(snum is equal to
tale. Condiynus is generally used in disparaging comparisons,
but this passage shows that that was not so always.

43. admodum quam. Ussing quotes Gell. 19. 9. 10, Voce
admodum quam suavi. Quam is used as an intensive particle
both by itself and joined with other words denoting excess:
admodum, per, nimium. The idiom is thought by some to be
derived from an ellipse denoting surprise, which is sometimes
supplied both in Greek and Latin, as in such phrases as
θαυμάσιον ὅσον, θαυμαστόν ὡς, mirum quam, immane quantum.

44. Numquid vis. The common formula of farewell ε ‘ have
you any commands.' Hor. Sat. 1. 9. 6, Numquid vis occupo,
wanting to get rid of the bore. The formula, although polite,
often laid open the door to a very rude reply. Ter. Ad. 3. 3.
78, SY. Num quid vis? DE. Mentem vobis meliorem clari.
Meu. 2. 2. 53, Numquid vis? ME. Ut eas maxumam in
malam crucem. Here a reply of an unexpected sort is made.
tamen: as Ussing remarks, tamen in this sense often occupies
the last word of the sentence. He quotes Capt. 1. 2. 84;
Epid. 3. 3. 45; 3. 4. 973 Mil. 3. 2. 51 ; 4. 7. 313 Poen. 5. 2.
