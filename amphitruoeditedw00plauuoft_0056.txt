l AMPHITRVO.

no reasonable doubt that hiatus was freely permitted
at the strong pause caused by change of speakers. It
corresponds to syllaba anceps permitted at change of
speakers : see supra, p. xxvi.

6. Hiatus after and before proper names. Both in
Greek and Latin dramatic metres proper names are
to a considerable extent lembus solata. Plautus
(and his imitators toeven a greater ext-ent in the
spurious prologues and other adjecticious parts of
the plays) undoubtedly seems to have permitted
hiatus both before and after proper names more than
in other parts. The Amphitruo furnishes a considerable

number of instances which it would be rash to alter.
1. 1. 121 :

Nec Iugulae neque Vesperugo neque Vergiliae occidunt.

1. 2.9;

Comple'bo atque omnem Amphitruonis familiam.

Short vowel before a mute and liquid. A
vowel short by nature cannot be lengthened by position

before a mute and liquid. This law applies to Greek
comedy as well, but not to Greek tragedy. It is
observed in both Roman comedy and tragedy. Such .
scansions as πᾶτρος, ὅδμη, {mos are, as a rule, im-
possible in Greek comedy 3 such scansions as patris,
muliebris, ‘migro are impossible in ancient Roman
tragedy and comedy alike.
