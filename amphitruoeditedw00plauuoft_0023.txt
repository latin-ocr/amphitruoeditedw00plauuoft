INTROD U CTI ΟΝ. xvii

adapter, but I am now comparing him with an
adapter. Neither Moliere nor Dryden for one in-
stant arrived at the conception of the loving husband
and faithful wife which Plautus places before us.
The play is the most simple, dignified, and tender of
all the plays of Plautus.

Amphitruo uxorem salutat laetus speratam suam,
quam omnium Thebis vir unam esse optumam diiudicat,
quamque adeo cives Thebani vero rumiferant probam :

these are the becoming words in which the returning
warrior salutes his wife. And we have a fine concep-
tion of a woman's duties put into the mouth of

Alcumena,

non ego illam mihi dotem duco esse, quae dos dicitur,

sed pudicitiam et pudorem et sedatum cupidinem,

deum metum, parentum amorem et cognatum concordiam,
tibi morigera atque ut munifica sim bonis, prosim probis.

and in the indignant but calm

nunc, quando factis me impudicis abstinei,

ab impudicis dictis avorti volo.
But the tenderness of a loving wife cannot be
prevented from breaking out when Amphitruo, as
she thinks him, invokes the anger of Jupiter on

himself:
ah propitius sit potius:
which has its counterpart in Amphitruo's exclamation
on hearing of his wife’s happy delivery :
iam istuc gaudeo,
ut ut erga me meritast.
