THE ARGUMENTS.

THERE was formerly a double set of Arguments to the plays
of Plautus: a non-acrostich and an acrostich set. Of the
non-acrostich set all but five have perished3 those of the
Amphitruo, Aulularia, Miles, Mercator, and Pseudolus, which
last is preserved in the Ambrosian MS. alone: this MS. also
preserves some traces of an argument to the Persa. Both
these sets of arguments are much later than Plautus. Ritschl
(ProZ. Trin. p. 316 sqq.) refers the non-acrostich arguments to
the times of the Antonines. These Arguments are all com-
prised in fifteen verses, except that of the Amphitruo, which
has only ten. Now it 15 known that the Arguments of the
plays of Terence, each in twelve verses, and the poem con-
taining the arguments of the twelve books of the Aeneicl, each
in six verses, were the work of Sulpicius Apollinaris of
Carthage, who lived about the middle of the second century
A.D. Hence Ritschl has attributed the Plautine Arguments
also to Sulpicius, and this conjecture is now generally ac-
cepted. An earlier age may perhaps have given birth to the
Acrostich Arguments. During the Tth century A.U.C. (about
100 B.c.), the study of Plautus was much affected by gram-
marian& at Rome. Among these Aurelius Opilius has been
pitched on by Osann as a likely person to have written the
Acrostich Arguments. Opilius gave up his school at Rome
about 92 B.c., to accompany his friend Rutilius Rufus, con-
demned for extortion, ‘co Asia. Gellius (3. 3. 1) mentions

Δ him as an author of indices on Plautus. He wrote a book

called Pinax, with his own name Opilius in an acrostich on

the title page. This book Pinax is supposed to have treated

of Plautine subjects. Osann's guess is a happy one3 but it

has scarcely as great certainty as that of Ritschl respecting
