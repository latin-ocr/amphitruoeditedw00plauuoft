trochaic than in iambie verse. The trochaic caesura of
a dactylis forbidden, save in the first foot ε ale„ a daetyl
should not be divided‚ so that its first two syllables
belong to one word, and its last syllable to another,
except in the first foot: Trz'n. 2. 4. 23 (Ritschl) is
correct:

Mille drachumarum tarpezitae Olffmpico.

Division of Anapaests. An anapaest should not
be divided in iambic or troohaio verse, so that its
first syllable is the last of a (lissyllable or poly-
syllable, or so that its two first syllables are the two
last of a polysyllable. Thus Aul. ἱ). 7. 25 :

Confige sagittis fures thensaurarios,1

Mil. 3. 2. 39:

Ibi erat bilibris aqualis sie propter cados,
Amph. Prol. 55 :

Comoedia ut sit omnibus isdem versibus,

are not Plautine.

Prepositions as usual are exceptional 3 and the last
syllable of inter, propter, may begin an anapaest.
Thus there is no objection to Ter. And. l. 1. 128:

Si propter amorem uxorem nolet ducere :

nor to Mil. 4. 7. 1, 5.
Anapaestic metr& admits only anapaests,

¹ 11: is curious that the simple correction confice has not bes-n
made here, ‘ despatch with your arrows.' Cf. Truc. 2. 7. 52,
ze heu: (sc. machaera) offatim conficiam. Cf. Pseud. 1. 5. 49.
