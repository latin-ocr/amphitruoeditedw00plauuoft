PERSA, 3. 3. 30.

Ubi quid credideris, citius extemplo a foro
Fugiunt, quam ex porta ludis quom emis sust lepus.

One of Plautus' 3 many jibes at the frequent suspensions of
payment on the part of Roman bankers. What gate is meant
in the second line? The gate of the circus, says Ussing.
Whither, then, did the hare run so fast? Into the arena?
This would be to meet his foes, the dogs : for surely the hare
was enlarged for a coursing match. Or away from the circus,
outwards? This would be prevented, and the spectators

The sporta was a box or hamper of wicker-work used for
various purposes, and doubtless of various sizes: fishing-
baskets for instance were called sportae .· fowls were fattened
shut up in sportae, so tightly shut in, as only to be able to
exsert their beaks to peck their food ε 3 fragment of Sallust
tells us that 011 301113 occasion unknown to us dogs were let
down from walls in sportae: though in this passage it has
been proposed to read panes for canes without the slightest
warrant. Acidalius was doubtless right in reading in Merc.
5. 4. 28, Iam obsecro hercle habete vobi-s cum sportis cmnfiscina
where the MSS. give the utterly unintelligible porcis. ‘ Take
and keep her baskets and hamper ! ' the metaphor being per·
haps from the sale of a donkey or mule.

Pom-nmis, 3. 1. 5 seqq.

Altque equidem hercle dedita opera amicos fugitavi senes :
Scibam aetate tardiores, metui meo amori moram.
Nequiquam hos procos mi elegi loripedes tardissumos.

No one seems to know what procos means 1n vs. 3. It seems
strange that porcos has not been suggested ε ‘ these lazy hoga’
