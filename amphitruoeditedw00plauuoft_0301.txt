“you may be quite sure he and his ship have gone to the
bottom.” So Lucret. 2. 809, scilicet esse 9lobosa. The same
construction of videlicet is sometimes found in Plautus and

escentem .· this construction also appears in Lucretius, 1. 210,
esse videlicet in terris primordia rerum, andin Cicero's Letters,
Ait. 5. 11. 7, tum videlicet datas. See Tyrrell's note on this
