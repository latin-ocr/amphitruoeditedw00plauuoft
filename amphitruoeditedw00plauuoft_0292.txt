230 AMPHITRVO. Am* IV.

sedebam infit me percontarier. In Epid. 2. 2. 13 sqq„ nearly
the same catalogue of places is given :—

Per medicinas, per tonstrinas, in gymnasio atque in foro,
Per myropolia. 013 lanienas circumque argentarias.

Catullus thus describes (55) how he sought his friend :—

Te quaesivimus in minore Campo,
Te in Circo, 130 111 omnibus libellis,
Te in templo superi Iovis sacrato
In Magni simul ambulatione.

7. pergam exquirere. Cf. pergam exequi, 2. 2. 169.

8. compleverit, perhaps ‘ tainted,' ‘ stained,’ like the Greek

{qawcgffggvac, ‘to infectass Plat. Apol. 32 (D). So implere,
iv, . .

9. amittere, ‘let gos ‘dismiss.’

10. mortuom satiust, sc. esse. Cf. Cas. l. 1. 24, hercle me
suspendio Quam τα eius potior fias satiust mortuom. aedis
occluserunt, 13110 (1001· of the house was 10113 unlocked, unbarred,
during 13110 day, surely 11013 open, as Ussing says. Most. 2. 2.
14, Sed quid hoc? occlusa ianuast interdius. occludere was
the regular word for barring the door on the inside, Aul. 1.
2. 25, occlude sis Fores ambobus pessulis. See ΜΓ. Martley,
Hermathena, 8. 303, Sonnenschein on Most. 1. l. eugepae
(probably the exclamations εὖγε and παπαῖ combined and
contracted), an exclamation of wonder and satisfaction com-
bined, though often 13110 satisfaction is ironical as here. This
ironical application of 13110 word is found Capt. 4. 2. 43, Oapt.
2. 2. 24, chd. 2. 4. 24: without irony, Pseud. l. 2. 81.

12. The second ecquis is a pyrrhic here, as in other passages;
but the ordinary scansion is also common. q seems 130 have
had a shortening effect on a syllable ending in c. So hic qui-
dem or mquidem in Plautus always.

Aer IV. 2.

Α dialogue between Amphitruo, knocking at 13110 house door,
and Mercury, who is on the roof, interrupted‚ mayno litterarum
damno, at vs, 14, by the loss of several leaves of the
archetype.
