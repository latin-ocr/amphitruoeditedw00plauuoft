declined of the first declension and the e is shortened, through
the Aeolic σχέμα. Priscian quotes this passage for the form,
adding Pers. 4. 2. 2, lepida condecorat schema; Caecilius (v. 76,
Ribbeck), Filius in me incedit sat hilara schema. Nonius
quotes Pomponius (150, Ribbeck). Other words thus declined
were syrma(Va1erius)‚ diadema (Pomponius), doymo (Laberius),
gylaucoma, Mil. 2. 1. 70.

120. eccum and eccillum are often used even of those who
are off the stage. Cf. Aul. 4. 10. 51, eccillam domi; Pers.
2. 2. 44, Ubi illa alterast furtifica laeva? PA. Domi eccam :
nam huc nullam attuli, where there should not be a doubt
as to the punctuation. eccum is not joined with est by
Plautus, Langen says. But we are not to suppose eccum to be
‚joined with est here : it is quite independent of it in construc-
tion, as it is of stat in ill il. 4. 6. 7, cited in note on l. 2. 35.

123. versipelles were properly those who, by means of
magio, were able to transform themselves into wild animale,
wolves especially, but in early Latin we several times meet it
used of being able to assume any disguise. Quo libet qenere se
commutantes: Nonius. Lucil. 530 (Lach.)‚ Quicum versipellis
fio et quicum commuto omnia. In Pers. 2. 2. 48, capillus
versipellis is hair which is turning grey. Bacch. 4. 4. 12,
vorsipellem fraqi com-enit esse hominem pectus quoi sapit, i.e.
ready to adapt himself to circumstances.

125. Amphitruone. The hiatus after the long proper name
is justifiable. in exercitum: Plautus often shortens the
syllable ex· in this position, i.e. when a monosyllable, or a
monosyllable by eiision, precedes, which with the syllable ex-
makes up the arsis or thesis of a foot. See Mueller, Prol.

Plaut. p. 281, 311 seqq.

126. praeservire. The preposition denotes readiness to meet
his master’s wishes. Lucil. 910 (Lach.), praeseri-it, labra
delingit delenit amore, used, apparently, of a fond wife.

132. complexus: sc. eam. The omission of the antecedent
is quite Plautine. See on vs. 38 supra.

133. ‘ini’ : there=illic.· Plautus uses both forms. ad leg-i-
onem, ‘ with the army.' LesJio several timeszexercitzae in
Plautus, a relic of the time when one legion formed the Roman
