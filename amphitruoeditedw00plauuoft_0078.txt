diaeresis: if this be objected to, homones may be read, as
Mueller says, The metre of the following piece has
been variously treated by Hermann, Elem. Doct. Matr.
p. 393 ; by Mueller, Pros. p. 350 ,· by L. Spengel, Pkilol. τοῖ.
17, p. 5641 ; A. Spengel, Plautus, p. 127 and Rcformvorschlctqe,
p. 334 (see Appendix Ι.); Ο. Seyffert, de vers. bacch. p. 2] ,·
Studemund‚ de Cant. Plaut. p. 57‚· W. Christ, Metrik. Iregard
the metre of 8 as Ionio a minore. I insert 690, which is not
in the MSS„ as it is uncertain whether Plautus would have
lengthened the last syllable of publicitus. Save that there
are two resolutions the verse is on the model of such lines as
Oed. R. 486: πέτομαι δ’ ἐλπίσιν οὔτ’ ἐνθάδ’ ὀρῶν οὔτ’ ὀπίσω.
Vss. 7, 8 are broken up by Mueller, followed by LG, into four
short trochaics: Fleck. and Leo follow one of Hermann’s
proposals by which they become (very bad) anapaestic lines.
Priscian (G. L. 3. p. 422) scans ita pereyre adveniens and
qui hoc noctis α portu as brachycatalectic Iambic dimeters:
inyratz's excitavit as a catalectic Iambic dimeter : and hospitio
publicitus accipiar as a hypercatalectic Iambic dimeter, show-
ing that he was very much in the' dark as to the metre. Vs.
19 is in the 31ss.‘placed between 7 and 8 as well as in its
proper place—9. Trochaic dimeter catalectic: 9 and 10 are
written as one verse in M.-10. With Leo I write this v. as
Bacchiae hexameter—porca the MSS. with hiatus: Plautus
wrote porcud.—ll. A'onne M, Non me Spengel. me mittere
M, mc om. Spengel, who scans the verse as an anapaestic
dimeter. After much hesitation I follow him. The shorten-
ing of hoc and of the last syllable of servitus in the next verse
