anapaestic metre, and introduce it freely in doubtful
cases.

ΟΥΕ-31510 metre consists of cretics (αῑῖ’ῐᾰγηεῐῃί);
if the first syllable be resolved, a fourth paeon
results affluerent), if the last syllable be resolved,
a first paeon results (debilia). A molossus (occidant)
is sometimes allowed as a substitute.1 One syllable
of the molossus may be resolved at a time, and these
are the only variations in cretic metre. The most
common of cretio metros is the cretic tetrameter, of
which we have good examples, 1. 1. 65 seqq. τ

and the following lines supply instances of each
legitimate variation.

The clausulae of cretio metre are generally trochaic,
with which metre cretio has an affinity: Amph. 1. l.
83, 93.

Plautus is very fond of bacchiac matre.
He employs bacchiac tetrameters chiefly, but also
bacchjac hexameters, bacchiac dimeters, and bacchiac
trimeters. A. Spengel denies the existence of the ·
last species of verse. The point is 3 doubtful one.
In this edition 1. l. 24, 25 are arranged as tri-
meters.

¹ If the medial syllable of the molossus be resolved, the
result is a choriambus. Spengel denies this variation. The

Amphitruo has no instance of it.
