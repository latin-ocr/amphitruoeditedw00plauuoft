kidnapped. It was not without separate pangs that I
parted with aliquo saltu, Mil. 2. 2. 66, which is due to A.
Kiessling: ovis, Pers. 2. 1. 6, which is claimed by O.
Seyffert: and di iuvere, Cas. 2. 6. 65, which belongs to
A. Spengel. One of the chief discouragements to the
emendator is the fact that he so often finds his con-
jecture anticipated‚ not in any accessible edition, but
in some recondite German periodical.

I desire to return my best thanks to Professor E.
A. Sonnenschein, and to my friends and colleagues,
Mr. L. O. Purser and Mr. J. I. Beare, for reading

my proofs, and for many important suggestions and

criticisms.
