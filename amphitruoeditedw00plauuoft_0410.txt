“Among the numerous sets of readers before the public the present series is
honourably distinguished by the marked superiority of its materials and the
careful ability with which they have been adapted to the growing capacity of the
pupils. The plan os the two pumers is excellent for facilitating the child’s first
attempts to read. In the first three following books there is abundance of enter-
tain-Ing reading. . . . . Better food for young minds could hardly be found.''-
