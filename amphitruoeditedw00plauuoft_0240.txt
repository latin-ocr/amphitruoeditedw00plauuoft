178 AMPHITRVO. ACT 1.

1. 107. 10, Quid parcis tibi, Rufe? dormiendum est, to a diluter
of his wine. Tibi must be supplied from the second clause, as
there is no authority for using the verb without a case.

3. tollito. Referring to the custom of a father taking up the
newly born child and aoknowledging it. Ter. And. 1. 3. 14,
Quidquid peperisset decreverunt tollere ; Mil. 2. 3. 22, Verum
euim tu iscam, si te di ament, temere hau tollas fabulam, ‘ you
would not father that story ’ (Tyrrell). quod, neuter, for an
obvious reason. Cicero is not to be excused in the same way
for saying of his new-born child ad Act. 10. 18, Quod quidem
est uatum perimbecillum est.

5. distaedeat: dis seems to have an intensive force in this
verb, as in discupio, dispudet, disperii. It occurs Ter. Phorm.
5. 8. 223 Masur. Sabin. ap. Maerob. Sat. 3. 6, Postquam artis
discisus suae est.

6. adest ad exercitum: see on Prol. 125.

7. quod. It is possible, but not certain, that quod is an
arehaie abl. as Ritschl supposed ; it may be the nom. Both
constructions, two ablatives, and nominative and ablative, are
used by Plautus. Ussing quotes for the latter istuc exquisito
opus est infra, 2. 1. 83; 2. 2. 159. So Uist. 1. 2. 10;
Ter. Hee. 5. 4. 38. With pronouns, the nominative (quid,
quod, istuc, facto usus est) is more usual. As to the S. C.
of Cic. Fam. 8. 8. 5, si quid de ea re ad populum plebemve
lato opus esset, quoted by Ussing, Ritschl would have replied
that quid was there the ablative, and was naturally preserved
in an ancient formula, though perhaps misunderstood to be a
nominative. See Note, 2. 2. 87 infra.

S. scitus sycophanta, ‘ a elever rogue.' Graphieus is some-
times used by Plautus in this sense : ‘ knowing ² is the prim-
ary idea. Scitus is applied by Plautus to a female figure,
satis scitum filum mulieris, ‘ a fine figure of a woman ’ ; M erc.
4. 4. 153 scitus puer, Ter. Andr. 3. 2. 16, is ‘a fine boy.’
Plautus puns on the word, Pseud. 2. 4. 58, Ecquid is homo
scitust .? CHA. Plebiscitum uon est scitius, ‘a statute is not as
astute.’ In classical Latin the word only retained the sense
of ‘clever,' ‘witty.'

qui quidem meus sit pater, (and no wonder) for he is my
father. Mercury is the patron of roguery. Hor. C'arm. l. 10.
9. qui sit, giving the reason of the mental ellipse.
