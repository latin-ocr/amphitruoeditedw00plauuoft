PROL. NOTES (1-6 LG). 129

The remaining plays have no Prologue: though in the Mile-s·
and Cistellaria a Prologue is practically put in 'the mouth of
an actor at a later stage of the play.

l. Mercury speaks in his character of messenger of Jupiter
and god of bargains: κερδῷος, ἐριούνιος. Blera-urias is from
⁷ the root of merx. Cp. Horace, Sat. 2. 3, where Damasippus
got the surname of Mercurialis from his cleverness in driving
bargains. vos vostris voltis: note the alliteration, a charac-
teristic of early Latin, as of early English poetry, that of
Spenser for instance. See Munro's Lucretius, Introd. p. 15.
It is extremely common in Ennius, Plautus, and Lucretius.
Munro cites from Captivi, 4. 3. 3:

Quanta pernis pestis veniet, quanta labes larido,
Quanta sumini apsumeslo, quanta callo calamitas,
Quanta laniis lassitudo, quanta porcinariis.

4. rationes, ‘plans‚' ‘speculations.' vostrorum = vostrum,
vostri. So Most. l. 3. 123: pars 7,·ostrorum; Aul. 2. 4. 42:
uter vostrorum. Cf. Pseud. 2. 1. 9. So nostrorum, infra, Fraq.
18 ; Poen. 4. 2. 39. Even the feminine forms, vostrarum
and vostrarum, are used: see Truc. 2. 1. 4Ο; Pseud. l. 2. 533
Stich. 1. 2. 843 Ter. E'zm. 4. 4. 11 ; Hec. 2. 1. 43. Can these
genitives be derived from the colloquial use of noster aszeyo?
See infra on noster, 1. 1. 245.

5. expedire, intransitive, ‘ to turn out.' Cf. l. 3. 23:
nequiter paene expedivit prima parasitatio. Langen has
pointed out that expetivit, the conjecture of Lambinus, will
not suit the latter passage, as expetere is rather ‘to befall‚'
and is used with in, l. 2. 33, or with dative, as 3. 1. 12, infra3
but not with adverbs denoting ill, well. So expedivit must be
sound : and if sound with nequiter, it may be sound with bene
in the same sense. There is therefore no reason to take ex-
pedz're transitively here, ‘to furthe1·,' ‘bless,' with Ussing:
even less to read me before it': with him. peregri, ‘ abroad.'
Pereqre is the form correctly used of going abroad, or of com-
ing from abroad: Charisius, p. 212, Keil. The forms were,
however, confounded in MSS. peregrique et: Ussing quotes
several other instances of -que et from Plautus.

6. auctare: properly used of divine blessing. Catull. 67.
2, Salve teque bona luppiter auctet ope.
