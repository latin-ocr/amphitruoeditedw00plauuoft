against supposing himself at liberty to extend synizesis
beyond these limits. Such contractions as praemiorum,

metre. The laws of bacchiac and cretic metre
are just as strict in this respect as iambic and

Although the metrical accent accounts for a
large number of shortening of syllables long by
position, it was assisted in many cases by the natural
process of syncope or slurring of words, especially
of words containing the liquids l, Δν, 71. This is a

attention it deserves‚ nor is this the place to ‘creat it at

break new ground in this direction, the tendency
with them being to ascribe everything to accent-
The only great critic who has taken a right vieW,

half far enough. The limits he puts to syncope
(Prol. Tria. p. cxliv.) are (1) that all words so
affected are nouns or particleS, not verbs 3 (2) that
they are iambic words 3 (3) that they nearly always
