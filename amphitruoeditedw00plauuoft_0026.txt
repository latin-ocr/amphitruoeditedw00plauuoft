are left, among good MSS„ to Β and D (M), for C,1 the
Decurtatus of CamerariUS‚ contains the last twelve
plays only.

B, the Codex Vetus of Camerarius, a cursive MS.
of the llth century, now in the Vatican library at
Rome. The oldest MS. extant with the exception
of the Ambrosian. It contains all the plays.

D, the Codex Ursinianus, having been the property
of Cardinal Orsini, an excellent MS. of the l2th
century. It contains the last twelve plays, and
prefixed to these The Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia,
and the Captivi, up to 2. 3. 4.

D is little if at all inferior to B: often in my

judgment its tradition is preferable to that of B.
See notes on 5.1.31; 1.1.80; 2. 2. 903 2. 2. 39.

Of inferior MSS. (m) the chief are Ε, F, J.

E is a MS. of the l5th century, first collated by
Ritschl‚ whose property E was. Ritschl attached too
much weight to the readings of his MS„ and is followed
in so doing by his successore- Goetz and Loewe.

J, now in the British Museum, a MS. of the llth or
12th century, the merits of which are not equal to its
antiquity.2

1For a fun account of these MSS. the reader is referred to
Ritschl, Prolegomena to the Trinummws, p. 27 seqq.: and his
opuscula, vol. ii. p. 1-34.

2The character of J can be studied in Sonnenschein's

collation of this MS. in his edition of the Captivi, and in
VVagner’s edition of the Aulularia.
