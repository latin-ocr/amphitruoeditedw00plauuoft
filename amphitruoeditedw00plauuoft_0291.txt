17. escendere. The preposition e seems to have beon
specially used in compounds denoting climbing or soaring.
Evelzi is ‘to soar'3 eluctari, ‘to struggle up’ ; erepere, ‘to
crawl up‚' Hor. Sat. 1. 5. 79.

illuc sursum, he points to the roof.

23. siquidem here, but siquidem is sometimes the scansion ;
in which case it is perhaps best to write it si quidem. The
first syllable of siquidem is short in the best age. Brix denies
the shortening of the first syllable in Plautus, Mil. 1. 1. 28,
but it was admitted by Ritschl. Siquidem is often, though
not here, demanded by Luchs's theory that quidem never has
the accent on its first syllable save in the first foot.

24. ornatum, ‘dress‚' ‘get up.' Mil. 4. 4. 67, ornain
{halas—sico, ‘a sailor’s dress.' qui potis decet, ‘suitable for
drunken men.' Decet governs a dative in old Latin. Cf.
9eneri, 2. 2. 188 supra3 ui (lecet lenonis familiae, Pers. 2. 2. 31 ;
ut vobis decet, Ter. Ad. 3. 4. 453 5. 8. 53 Lucr. l. 885.

Amphitruo returns after a vain hunt after Naucrates. Hc

1. Naucratem quem erat, a well-known attraction of a
nominative to the accusative of the relative. Virg. Aen. l.
573, Urbem, quam statuo vestra est; Cure. 3. 49, Istum quem
quaeris 690 sum.

3. plateas, ‘squares'3 πλατεῖα, platea, hence place. per-
reptavi, ‘crawled through'3 the expression denotes slow
wearisome toil. Ter. Aci. 4. 6. 3, perreptavi ‘usquc omne,
oppidum. myropolia: the shops of the retailers of persumery
are mentioned by Lys. dc Ion-alid. 20, quoted by Ussing, as
one of the haunts of idle men, along with a barber's shop and
a shoemaker's shop.

4. emporium, ‘the bazaar‚’ a general term for the business
part of the town. macello, ‘the meat market.' medicinis,
‘doctors' shops': the termination has the same force as in
officina. tonstrinae3 barbers’ shops were the most usual haunt
of men about town. Hor. Sat. 1. 7. 3, Omnibus ei lippis·
notum et tonsoribus esse ,· Asin. 2. 2. 76, Verum in tonstrina uc
