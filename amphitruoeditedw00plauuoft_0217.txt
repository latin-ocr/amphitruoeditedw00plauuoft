sc. Ι. NOTES <275-283>. 155

is perhaps more common in classical Latin if in the sense of
⁶ investing. '

125. neque ε this may reply to neque in 122, but perhaps
neque is here simply archaic for non. In the phrase nec
recte dicere, it stands for ‘non .· so in «nequeo, necopinata-3, and
neque eo, which according to Festus is the same as non eo. So
necuter, ‘res nec mancipi, wegyolizcm, etc., preserve this old usage.
*Veque certainly is used often by Plautus, not as a disjunctive,
but as simply making a negative statement which agrees with
the train 01 thought 01 the speaker. See note on 4. 3. 2.

126. nisi item unam : Spengel, Plautus, p. 204, defended
this hiatus, which he allowed after dissyllables which together
form a resolved arsis. But it is not accepted by recent critics.
The introduction 01 sz' is very easy here : and the other
passages in the Amphitruo which seem to defend this hiatus

are as easily emender¹ ·

2. 2. 43. mage nunc me'um officium facere si huic eam advor
sum arbitror.

1. 77. non soleo ego somniculose eri imneria persequi.

1. 34. Amphitruo piam et pudicam tuam esse uxorem ut
selas.

. 1. 54. N 611 metuo quin meae uxori latae suppetiae sient.

*Ut

cavit manu.

These are all to be corrected: see the notes on these passages
perpetem ε the archaic form for perpernam which Plautus

ἢ

once joins to noctem, le. ⁶2. ο. 40, for the sake 01 his metre :
Iactatae exemplis plurimis miserae perpetuam noctem.

He often uses other parts 01 perpetuus, but no other case os
perpes save the accusative. In post-classic writers we find a
nom. perpes and ablative perpeti or perpete. pependi : slaves
were hung up by the hands to be fiogged, As. 3. 2. 18 : or 101·
mere torture, with aweight attached to the feet, Ibid. 2. 2. 37.

123. atque, intensive, by itself = καὶ ταῦτα, ‘yes and properly
drunk.’ Atque adeo is stronger. probe is used in such phrases
exactly as our ‘ properly.’ Of. Bwl. 2. 7. 8, si probe adpotus
siem.’ Cf. occillet probe, vs. 29 supra.

129. mira sunt, ‘it’s a wonder.’ Both mira sunt and
mirum est are 01 frequent occurrence in Plautus. Cf. Capi.
