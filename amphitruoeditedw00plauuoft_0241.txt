sc. 111. - NOTE'S (501-519). 179

9. Ussing says that the text is proved to be unsound by the
future palpabitur. That is not so, the future is perfectly
correct. There is nothing strange that Mercury should say
‘ watch him, how he will coax the woman.' palpabitur, ‘stroke
her'3 the word is applied properly to ‘stroking,' ‘patting'
horses: cf. Hor. Sat. 2. 1. 18, Oui male si palpare, recalcitrat
undique tutus, where palpari takes the dative, as here; the
accusative is generally used after palpare, perhaps after pal·
pari, Lucil. 799 (Lach.). Servius on Aen. 11. 728 read
suppalpatur mulieri, Donatus on Ter. Prot. Ad. 2, palpetur
mulieri. The former was probably a reminiscence of matri
suppalparier, Mil. 2. 1. 28.

12. illa: i.e. tua uxor, Jun0.

13. ego faxim, ‘I’ll warrant,' a common colloquialism.
Merc. 4. 6. 10, Ecastor faxim si itidem plectantur viri, Plures
viri sint vidui quam nunc mulieres.

15. lectus, genitive. The archaic declension of lectus is
testified by Priscian, who quotes this passage, and Cornificius
de etymis deorum, for the nom. plural, ‘ipsis vero ad Cereris
‘memoriae novandae qratiam lectus stcmi‘tmtur' (Ussing). In Cat.
57. 7, the best MS. (O) preserves lecticulo, which must have
come from a form of the fourth declension. See Munro, Crit.
ancl E'Zuc. p. 132. concaluit, ‘had time to get warm.’ ubi
cubuisti: bad though the diaeresis is, Bothe's transposition is
unlikely, as the evidence for ubi 111 Plautus is weak: for ibi
weaker still, as Mueller says.

17. subparasitabor, ‘ back him up ’ by taking his part like
a parasite.

19. ecflictim amare, ‘ to love to distraction,’ was a common
phrase with the old dramatists = deperire.

21. hanc rem curatio aut muttitio, ‘ what business have you
to interfere with this matter, or to mutter a syllable about
it?’ Verbal nouns 'm -z'o often are found in the old writers
governing the case which the verb, from which they are
derived, governed. Ussing gives the following list: A sin. 5.
2. 70, Quid tibi hunc receptio ad te est? Aul. 4. 10. 14, Quid
tibi nos tactio est ,2 a phrase which occurs several times in other
plays. Most. 1. 1. 33, Quid tibi me aut quid 690 aqam curatio
est? Bucl. 2. 6. 18, Quid mihi scelesto tibi crat auscultatio?
Quidve hinc abitio, quidve in navem inscensio? Caecil. v, (52
