ing before one is out of the wood. The following are the
passages where numero is found in Plautus: Cas. 3. 5. 21,
numero (licis ; M en. 2. 2. 13, numero huc advenis ατί prandium ,-
Mil. 5. 7, Perii. Haud etiam, numero hoc clici-Q· Poen. 5.
4. 101, 0 Apella, o Zeuxis pictor, cur numero estis mortui?
Mero. 4. 3. 37, numero puryitas. Seven instances are given
of this numero in Ribbeck's Index to Lat. Comic Frag. in
mentem fuit. This archaic use of the accusative with in is
found in Bacch. 1. 2. 53, Ecquid in mentemst tibi Patrem tibi
esse. Cic. uses in potestatem, in dicionem esse ; and Prop. 3.
9. 60 has et α te ast, Quod ferar in partes ipse fuisse tuas. So

has several instances of this idiom.

28. merito meo, abl. ‘ according to my deserts.’ See note
on 2. 1. 22, infra. referre gratiam and habere qratiam .· 1)ιι1;
ayere qratia-s. This is the general rule. see Langen, p. ll.
According to him habere yratiam is found in Plautus twenty-
four times : referre qratiam, seventeen times , affere [sratz'czs.
nine times. The exceptions to these rules are chiefly found
in mixed expressions, or are corrupt.

29. allegent, ‘commission.' occulo, the reading of the mss,
might well mean ‘to harrow,’ a diminutive from occo, like
conscribam from cons-eribo .· and although anqillet, ‘ beat black
and blue‚’ is plausible, alliteration is in favour of oce-illa.
probe : see Note on adpotum probe l. 1. 128.

30. ingrata, passive, ‘shown no thanks for,' cf. Note on
Prol. 48. fecerant: cf. praefecerat, VS. 57 infra. The only
perfects in -erzmt, whose penultimate is shortened by Plautus,
are meruerunt, Most. 1. 3. 1243 subeyerunt, Bacch. 4. 9. 4;
locaverunt, Pers. 1. 3. 803 dormierunt, Poen. Prol. 21. Other
instances cited by Brix on Mil. 1. 1. 61 are not true instanceS.
The only really strong passage in favour of such a scansion
is postquam aediles emerunt, ending a trimeter, Ter. Eun.
ProZ. 21, but emerant may be right there in spite of the strong
testimony for emerunt. inrita, ‘ nullifie(l,' ‘ made of no effect,'

by getting into this dangerous escapade.

32. opinatus fui. Madvig, opusc. 2. p. 224, excepts Plau-
tus and his contemporaries from his law that snm is never in
good Latin the same as fni with the passive participle. In
