126 AMPHITRVO. ARG. 1.

Greek. So Alcumeus from Ἀλκμαίων, Capt. 3. 4. 30. Marius
Victorinus, quoted by Ribbeck, Fray. Scen. l. 228, iuxta autem
non ponebant c m : inde nec Alcmenam dicebant nec Tec-
mesam, sed Alcumenam [et Tecumesam]; inde Alcumeo
et Alcumena [et Tecumesa] trrayoedz‘affi donec Iulia-s
Caesar, qui et Vopiscus et Strabo et Sesquiculas dictus εει,
primas de Tecmesa scripsit trayoeclz'am suam et in scaena
pronuntiari iussit. A similar principle is seen at work in
Aesculapius, Hercules, drachman, etc.

ARGUMENT Π.

l. Alcumenas: an affected archaism‚ and, according to
Ritschl, Prol. Trin. p. 319, an erroneous affectation: for
Plautus, according to Ritschl, never used the genitive in -as
save in familia-3 (certum estc illius yenz'tz‘vi si ab uno familias
recesseris usum prorsas desiisse). Ritschl, however, changed
his mind on this point, as on various others, and has (MRE.
p. 115) defended or introduced genitives 'm as· in several places
—Pseztd. 4. 6. 38, molas coloniam ; Bacck. 2. 3. 73, Dianas
Ephe-siae ,· Pers. 3. 3. 5, pecunias· accipiter; even terrai-3 odiam,
Bacch. 4. 7. 22. So he proposed formas for formae, accepted
by Tyrrell, Mil. 4. 4. 12, where he read in his edition formae
iel. See note on familias infra, 2. 2. 199.

2. formam eius conjugis. Hiatus is more common in the
Acrostich Arguments than in the other set. I have counted
some twelve or thirteen of them, and of these nine 01· ten are
of syllables ending in -m. No‘ doubt hiatus of syllables
ending in -m was less offensive than others, but Plautus did
not carry it to this extent ; and the author of the Argument
was probably misled by the hiatus ‚of monosyllables ending
in -m in the first syllable of a resolved arsis, to extend the
license to other words also.

4. ei in Plautus and Terence has a three-sold scansion ; as a
monosyllable, an iambus, or spondee: the last most commonly,
Tyrrell, Miles, Arg. l. 4.

5. frustra habet, ‘ bemocks‚' ‘makes fools of‚² cf. frustra
sunt, 3. 3. 19 ; frustratur, 2. 2. 198.

6. turbas ciet, ‘blows up ' 3 cf. turbas concire, 1,. 2. 14, note.
7. invicem raptant, ‘they mutually arraign each other as
