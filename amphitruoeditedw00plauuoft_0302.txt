240 AMPHITRVO. Aer v. sc. 11.

9, 10. Quite grand in their simplicity.
11. in gratiam redi, ‘ make up friends again,' 3. 2. 61 supra.

12. haud promeruit quam ob rem vitio verteres, ‘she has
done nothing to deserve your blame.' Hor. Sat. 1. 6. 85,

vec timuit sibi ‘ne quis verteret. Vitio, a predicative or double
dative, like laudi.

15. In all the plays of Terence, ω is prefixed to plaudite,
both in the Bembine and. other iuss. ω is supposed to denote
the last speaker, the characters being designated by the letters
of the alphabet in the order they appeared on the stage. In
none of the plays of Plautus is this mark preserved save in the
Trinummus, before the final word plaudite. Wherever it is
possible to separate the final address to the spectators from the
preceding words, Ussing would insert this ω, but he leaves the
question open whether the final address was spoken by the

actor, or by a person distinct from the actor called Cantor.
Hor. A. P. 155 has the well-known words,

Si plausoris eges aulaea manentis, et usque
Sessuri donec cantor ‘ vos plaudite' dicat ε

this, joined with the fact of the mark ω being found, makes
it probable that the cantor, who had accompanied the cantica
in the play, intoned plaudite. But for the testimony of
Horace it would be more natural to suppose that Ω meant
merely the last word or words in the play, equivalent to our
Finis.
