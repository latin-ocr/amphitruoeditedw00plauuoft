lectio. There is no catalectic iambic tetrameter in
T 1⁷26 Amphitruo: in the acatalectic, 5. 1. 6 :

Animo malest aquam velim : corri'unpta sum atque absumpta
sum,

aquam should probably be written ccqz‘c'am or changed
to aquolam: see note. The commonest exceptions
to this rule are the expressions malam crucem and
bona fide, which several times end the verse, these
expressions being treated as single words.

The lambio septenarius (tetrameter catalectic)
or “laughing metre'⁷ allows the same feet as the
trimeter. The fourth foot is usually an iambus :
invariably so when it ends with a word. The
strong diaeresis after the fourth foot causes hiatus to
be regularly allowed, and a pyrrhic to be accepted as
an iambus. The seventh foot may, however, be a
tribrach, spondee, anapaest‚ or even dactyl, rarely a
proceleusmaticus: As. 2. 4. 24 (if sound).

The iambic octonarius (tetrameter acatalectic)
admits the same feet as the trimeter: the eighth foot
must be a pure iambus.

The Plautine trochaic tetrameter catalectic
or trochaic septenarius admits a trochee, spondee‚
dactyl, tribrach, or anapaest‚ in every foot, except the
last, which must be a trochee or tribrach : occasionally
a proceleusmaticus.
