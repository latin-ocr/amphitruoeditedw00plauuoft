172 AMPHITRVO. ΑοΤ 1.

77. hirnea was a small jar of earthenware for holding
wine, Cato, R. R. 81. The forms σίνηαι and cyrnea are given
in Nonius, and irnea is also found in MSS. W‘e have the
(liminutives hirnula, Cic. Paracl. 1. 11 (Ussing), and hirnella
or irnella, Festus. ln spite of Grimm’s law I fancy our
‘churn‚' originally an earthen vessel, must be connected

with hirnea.

280. qui egomet siem: the antecedent to qui is Sosia,
understood from the previous verse. Supply te esse Sosiam.
See 220 supra, qui 690 sum.

284. saltem: Men. 4. 2. 60, Num mihi es irata saltem? ‘at
least you are not angry with me?' sosia: I cannot believe
with Ussing that Plautus either here or in the next verse
lengthened the last syllable of Sosia when the correction in
both places is so simple: id or hoc inserted here by Mueller
is borne out by 2. l. 64, Sosia, hoc dici volo.

286. ignobilis, ‘unknown’z cf. Pseud. 4. 2. 9, quoted by
Ussing, Pereyrina facies videtur hominis atque iqnobz'lis ; Ibid,
2. 1. 18. But ‘ without a name' is what Mercury should say:
therefore I should much prefer Bothe's good conjecture,
zynomzms.

287. contemp1o: see on 3. 2. 3 infra. cognosco, ‘think
over‚' ‘ examine‚' mentally, as the next line shows.

289. petasum: supra, ProZ. 143. atque, 1. l. 120: ‘he is
as like (to me) as I am.'

290. tonsus archaic for tonsura. nasum, arohaic for nasus ;
it is used several times by Plautus. conversely dorsus is used
for dorsum, Mil. 2. 4. 44, Ita dorsus totus prurit ; and collus,
in the next verse is a common archaie form for collum ,· Capt.
2. 2. 107, collus collari caret. So corius, Poen. l. 1. 11; tergus,
As. 2. 2. 53. vel: see Crit. Note for defence of this word.

294. sane sapio, ‘I am in my sound senses' (not sane,
‘ certainly ²) : Cure. 1. 3. 20, Nam bonum est pauoeillum amare
sane, insane non bonum est. The phrase sane sapere occurs

several times in Plautus.

295. non obtempero, ‘I won't mind what he says.’ The
present with mm is much more idiomatie than the future in

stating a refusal. Most. 3. 1. 67, ‘non dat, non debet ‚· Ter.
Phorm. 4. 3. 64, Nil do : impuratus me ille ut etiam irrideat ,·
