anxious to recall that distracted creature to her semes?
amentem is clearly right, in my judgment‚ for amantem.
Alcumena is driven out of her wits by the false charge.
amantem has no point. For amem, of people driven wild by
anger, cf. Accius 450 (Ribb.)‚ Heu cor ira fervit caecum,
amentia rapior ferorque ; Catull. 64. 197, amenti caeca surore
(of deserted Ariadne); Virg. Aen. 4. 203, amens animi, et
rumore aecensus amaro. Amentem is demanded by ad sese,
‘ to herself,' zze. to her senses. Cf. the phrases apud se esse,
penes se esse; and ἔξω ἑαυτοῦ, ἐντὸς ἑαυτοῦ.

t 13b1negotium exhibuit, πράγματα παρέσχεν, ‘ got him into
rou e.

16. Et : continuative of Alcumena’s speech, vs. 9.
17. conloqui, with accusative, as 1. 1. 185.

18. quo te avortisti? ‘whither have you turned yourself
away ⁸? ' The editors generally prefer quom· but in the other
passages where the phrase occurs, Trac. 2. 4. 7, Titin. 93
(Ribb.), no MS. gives quor, though in the citation from
Titinius, all MSS. save one give quoa ; but I think this looks
like a beginning of ast-orcisti. Still quor may be right. ingeni
ingenium, ‘ my nature's nature? See Crit. Note. Cf. indolem
inqeni, Mil. 3. 3. 47.

19. osa sum. This passage is quoted by both Priscian, 9.
4. p. 517, and by Nonius p. 148, for this auxiliary form of odi,
the only passage in classical Latin where it occurs, though
perosus and exosus are both usual.

20. Heia autem inimicos? ‘how now? enemies, pray?⁷
Heia is here used as an expostulatory particle. Pers. 2. 2. 30
Heia! ‘Come‚ come‚’ to which Sophoclidisca replies Beicz!
‘Hum, hum.' The general use of heia is a particle of en·
couragement, of oheering, or urging a person on, ‘on with
you.' If we urge a person on to some better course, the
particle becomes expostulatory, so that the two usages har·
monize. . We are reminded of Shakespeare, Pericles Act 4.
Sc. 6, “ Some more, be sage,'' i.e. some dzfferent language.
autem, says Ussing, is used when we repeat another person's
words with wonder or contempt. He quotes Pseud. 305,
Metuo credere. PS. Credere autem? Ter. Eun. 798, qunc
non tanqam meam .? CH. Tuam autem? “ quotha ! ’'
