INTROD UCTION. xlvii

antistrophe to help us Many critics, including
Hermann, Studemund, W. Christ, Seyffert, and A.
Spengel, have devoted much attention to the Cantica,
with very different results. When we get outside the
ordinary bacchiac and cretic metres, it is scarcely
too much to say that all is uncertain. F ortunately
the Cantica of The Amphitruo are particularly simple
and easy, and I have no doubt as to the metre save
in some half dozen lines: though doubting, I have
been obliged to adopt some view as to these lines,
and in so doing Ι have tried to adhere as closely as
possible to the tradition of the MSS. I have printed in
Appendix I. A. Spengel’s arrangement of the Cantica.

Hiatus. ]. Hiatus is regularly allowed with
monosyllables when they form the first syllable of a
resolves] arsis. This hiatus all critics are agreed
about: 3. 2. 33:

Verum periclitatus sum animum tuom ;

1. 1. 249:

Quid, malum, non sum ego servos Amphitruonis Sosia?

2. Hiatus is regularly allowed in the diaeresis of
iambic octonarii or septenarii : 3. 4. 17 (iamb. oct.):

atque illuc sursum escendero : Ι inde optume aspellam virum;
Asin. 2. 3. 1 (iamb. sept.):
ut demonstratae sunt mihi Ι hasce aedis esse oportet.

There is no difference of opinion, nor is there any

possible on this point either.
