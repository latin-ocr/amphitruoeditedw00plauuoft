Lucr. 2. 388, Praeterea lumen per cornum transit. Mart. 14.
62, speaks of a lantern made of bladder ε

Cornea si non sum, numquid sum fuscior? aut me
Vesicam, contra qui venit, esse putat?

Pliny, 11. 126, tells us that the horns of the urus made
excellent lanterns, diffusing the light well.

189. Utcumque animo con-lubitumst meo: Ter. And. l. 5.
28, Quae meo cumque animo lubitumst facere: ‘just as I
choose.' As. 1. 1. 97.

190. Ain, here a spondee, as 147 supra. Aio enim: there is
hiatus at the change of speakers, and enim, as often, is a
pyrrhic. Mentire nunc: because Mercury had said verbero
(scoundrel), which Sosia pretends to understand as the present
indicative. The MSS. give mentiris nunc, which I have altered
to mentire with Bothe, not because aphaeresis of s is rare in
this place, as Ussing says, for this is just the very place where
aphaeresis of s is most common (see Note on Amphitruonis
sum, 257 infra), but because Plautus much prefers the form in
-e to the form in -2's ,· ‘ almost exclusively,' Brix on Mil. 2. 6.

191. dicere. There is no occasion to suppose that the last
syllable of dicere is long here. The last syllable of a dact-ylio.
word frequently takes the metrical accent. Without going
outside Terence we find so accented dicere, And. Prol. 233
Pamphile, And. 1. 5. 323 Bysrrh'ia, Ibid. 2. 1, 1; dicere, Ibid.
2. 5. 26 ; nubere, Ibid. 3. 3. 3 ; turpiter, Eun. 2. 1. 24; Chaerea,
Ibid. 4. 4. 393 omnia, Ibid. 4. 7. 19; filins, Heaut. 2. 1. 5;
omnia, Ibid. 5. 1. 69: 5. 5. 11«; Phaedria, Ibid. 5. 52;
credere, Ibid. 5. 9. 73 Pamphile, Hec. 3. 1. 103 4. 3. 15;
Aeschinus, Ad. 2. 3. 7 ; υἰνῃίηε, Act. 3. 2. 48 ; Sostrata, Ibid. 3.

263 viminis, Ibid. 4. 3. 73 Pamphila, 4. 4. 113 scilicet, 5. 3.
53. The large proportion of proper names, however, show
that it was semi-licentious. In this play we have so accented
Iuppiter, Prot. 943 ipsemet, 102; aedibus, 2. 2. 68 ; aedibus,
3. 2. 1. It is to be noticed that this accentuation generally
takes place in the third foot from the end, and often where
there is a strong stop : often at change of speakers: Brix on
Mil. l. l 27.
