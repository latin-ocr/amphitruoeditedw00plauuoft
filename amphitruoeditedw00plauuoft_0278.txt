216 AMPHITRVO. ACT 11.

205. proterve, protervus in Plautus and Terence, where the
metre shows the quantity3 so profecturus from proficisci,
Prin. 1. 2. 112: Plaut. also has profici-scor, and similarly
varied between profiteor and profiteor, Brut, Capi. 3. l. 20.
Neither confidentem nor protervus lose their bad sense here,
but virtue may be sels-confident and forward.

206. Enim verbis proba's, ‘ Yes, you are modest in words! '
See on enim, 2. 2. 26 supra. Probus often ‘modest,' opposite
of improbus, ‘bold.'

207—210. The finest lines in the play.
208. cupidinem: masc, as often, Hor. Sat. 1. 1. 61.

209. cognatum concordiam, ‘good will towards my re·
latives.' Cognatum is, of course, objective‚ as the other
genitives are. pudicitiam et pudorem, ‘ chastity and

modesty. ’

210. ut is trajected out of its place owing to the necessities
of the metre. See Crit. Notes on Prol. 9, Prol. 32, supra, for
Plautine traJections. morigera, an excellent word, denoting
the chief virtue of a good wife, that of consor-ming her will to
her husband's and being ever ready to make his likings her
own. Lucretius can find no better word when in some of his
most beautiful lines he describes the winning ways which a

woman of inferior beauty may possess : 4. 1274 seqq.—
Nec divinitus interdum, Venerisque sagittis
Deteriore fit ut forma muliercula ametur.
Nam facit ipsa suis interdum femina factis,

M molarisque modis et munde corpore culto,
Ut facile insuescat te secum degere vitam.

Cf. also the fine lines Ter. Anclr. 1.⁴ 5. 57 seqq. munifica sim
bonis, prosim probis, ‘be bounteous in kind services, do you
good with my goodness.’ Boni-5 and probis are, of course,
neuters used as nouns. See on Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 223, gaudens
Bellona cruentis. The good wife is described in Prov. 31. 12,
“ She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.’'

211. examussimst optuma, ‘a pattern of perstatim) We
are told by N onius that amussis meant a carpenter's rule.
Μ ost. 1. 2. 19, Aedesfactae probe ‹ea-amussim,- Blen. 50, U t hanc
rem vobis examussim disputem; Mil. 3. 1. 37, I nest in Ιιοο amussi-
tata sua sibi inqenua indoles. The same idea is in the words
