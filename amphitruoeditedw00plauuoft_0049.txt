dactyle, and spondees, and, occasionally‚ proceleus-
matici. The chief anapaestic metres are dimeters‚
tetrameters catalectic or septenariam, and tetra-
meters acatalectic or octonarians. In this edition,
vss. 1. 1. 11-13 are arranged as anapaestic dimeters 3
5. 1. 10 as an anapaestic octonarius. The accentua-
tion in anapaestic verse seems to have differed
greatly from that of iambic, still more from that of
trochaic verse. Dactyls seem to have been strongly
accented on the second syllable, causing an anoma-
lous shortening of the last syllable of a word, where
it would otherwise be long: 1. 1. 12 z

Opulento homini hoc servitus durast.

Conversion of bacchii into anapaests, common in
iambics‚ is naturally still more common in anapaestic
verse. Synizesis, perhaps owing to the difficulty of
the metre, was much more largely permitted than in
other metreS. The laws forbidding the consecution
of dactyl and anapaest, and those which govern the
division of the anapaest between two words in iambic
· and trochaic metre do not apply to Latin anapaestic
metre. No wonder then that critics are so ready
to prouounce any difficult line anapaestic, or that
this metre should have gained the title of the Home

for Incurables.1 C. F. W. Mueller and A. Spengel
