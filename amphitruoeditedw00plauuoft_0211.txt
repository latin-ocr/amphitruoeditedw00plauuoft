65. A learned editor makes a slip here by saying of exitumst:
molossus pro cretico; of course the middle syllable is short,
following the supine. Cf. Pers. 3. 3. fin.‚ dum stom reditum
oportuit. Equally, of course, the pres. pass. is exitur.

69. medii = in medium. Langen defending the conjecture
uterque imperator in medium exeunt, shows indeed that uterque
regularly takes a plural verb in Plautus, quoting Triu. 642,
celeri qradu eunt uterque, etc„ but he has not produced any
passage where uimque, taking a plural verb, is at the same
time joined to a singular noun.

78. edit: of performing exploits. Virg. A (172. 10. 602, 'salia
per campos edebat funera. So 887·chqu ediderit, 9. 785.

80. cadunt pulveris ui et uirum. I read pulv-eris for vulneris.
It is quite impossible that vulneris can be sound. Vulnus
could not be used collectively for vulnera. Secondly, et shows
that another cause beside anything caused by men is mentioned3
et virum: and wounds, being the work of men, are ποτ a dis-
tinct cause from men. Now we know that dust was a very
important cause contributing to defeat in ancient battles. At
the battle of Cannae, fought probably only a few years before
this play was acted, Livy tells us, 22. 46, ventus (Vulturnum
incolae regyiouis vocant) mullo pulvere in ips-a ora roh-endo pro-
spectum ademit ,· a cause of the defeat greatly exaggerated by
Silius, 9. 504, tum mole ruinae Sternuntur tellure et miles et arma
tubaeque ; a cause referred to by Juvenal, 11. 198, Cannarum iu
pulvere. victis. Plautus would not be unwilling to remind his
countrymen that it was not only owing to want of valour
that battles are lost. I need not add that pulveris comes in
very naturally after nebula. Cf. Macaulay, Bactle of the
Lake Reyillus, “And like the Pomptine sog at morn the dust
hung over head.” cadunt, ‘they fall,’ 226. ‘the combatants
fall,' not only the enemy. The overthrow of the enemy begins
in the next verse.

84. convortitur pro convertit, Nonius, p. 480. Doubtful
though this seems, yet emendation of the line is so uncertain,
that I have left the passage as in the Mss. Mueller, in his
edition of Nonius, speaks well of Ussing’s conjecture, sic tamen,
but does not change the text, though he obelizes it. fugam
in: Ussing shows that the anastrophe of prepositions. even
monosyllabic, is frequent in Plautus, quoting quo ab, qui pro,
