Le veritable Amphitryon

Est l'Amphitryon ou l'on dine.

It is from this passage Amphitryon has derived its meaning of
host in English. For partio instead of partior, see 3. 2. 3.

2. Neque ego. Ussing says a verse is wanting, for other-
wise quo neque referatur desideramus. He is quite wrong,
and the text is quite right. ,Neque was used m colloquial
Latin after a positive statement, not as containing another
·111;01’11111;1νο negative but as adding a 11810 negative statement.
which confirms what has been previously said. See note on

neque, 1. 1. 119. Cf. Illost. 3. 1. 71 :—

Ultro te ἰ neque ego taetriorem beluam
Vidisse me umquam quemquam quam te censeo.

3. adsis, ‘stand by me.’

8 regem: Cr,eon King of Thebes, whose general Amphitruo
was. recta (sc. vim· is common. me ducam, ‘betake myselfss
a colloquialism. Ussing quotes Bacch. 588, duc te ab aedanum
Ter. Hec. 522, duxit 88 sonex Pollio ad Cic. Fam. 10. 32. 1,
Balbus duxit se α Gadibus.

9. Thessalum veneficum. The Thessalians were famous
for their witelicraft. Hor. Carm. 1. 27. 21, Quis ze solvere
Thessalis illafflts venenis, quis poterit deu-5? JuV. 6. 6113
Lucan, Phars. 6. 614, 519 ; Hor. Epod. 5. 45.

10. pervorse perturbavit, ‘turned topsy-turvy.'

12. alter. We would not use ‘other ' in English, therein
differing from both Latin and Greek idiom. Alius, rursu-3,
iterum are often superfluous in Latin diction. Hor. δαί. 1, 4.
102, siquid promittere de me possum aliud vere; Virg. Aen.
10. 27, where see Henry's note.

13. ludificant ut lubet, ‘ fool to the top of their bent.

14. certumst, intro rumpam, ‘ I have made up my mind, I
will break in,' is just as good Latin as certumst introrumpere,
just as vir bonus est credo is as good Latin as virum bonum esse
credo. hominem, ‘human creatum? 2. 2. 137 supra.
