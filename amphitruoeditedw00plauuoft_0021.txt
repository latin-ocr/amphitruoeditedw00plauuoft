and it is most likely that T he Amphitruo is an exalted1
Rhinthon-z'ca. Traces of burlesque, for instance the
old age of Amphitruo, still exist, perhaps not noticed
by Plautus himself Ξ while the general sentiment and
treatment are those of comedy pure and simple. The
plot may be Rhinthon's, the treatment is that of
Plautus

We would gladly, if we dared, suppose the , play to ¹
be an original conception, but such a supposition is,
of course, impossible. But though not original, the
play is the most original of all the plays of Plautus.
A Roman tone pervades it. ln reading the account
given by Sosia of the campaign against the Teleboae,
we feel as if Plautus had versified a page of some old
Latin Annalist. The ultimatum of Amphitruo, with
its demand for restitution, and threat in case of refusal,
the pitched battle, and crushing defeat of the enemy:
the slaying of the commander-in-chief of the enemy

¹ There is a circumstance which inclines us to believe that
The Amphitruo was rather founded on than translated from
a Greek source. Plautus places Thebes near the sea shore.
The arrival of Amphitruo by sea at the harbour of Thebes is
several times stated, and is almost essentia] to the plot es
described by Plautus. No Greek poet could have made this
mistake. The Athenians knew Thebes as well as the
Romans knew Capua. Even a syracusan audience would have
hooted such ignorance. But Plautus was as careless of
geography as Shakespeare, who makes Bohemia a maritime

country.
