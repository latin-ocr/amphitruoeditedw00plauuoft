Loxbox, W.C., ‘J‘aszmzty‚ 1890.

OLASSlGS.

ELEMENTARY CLASSICS.

1 Smo, Eighteenpence each.

Tffls SERms FALLs mro Two CLASSES-

(1) First Reading Books for Beginners, provided not
only with Introductions and NoteS‚ but with
Vocabularies, and in some cases with Exercises
based upon the Text.

(2) Stepping-stones to the study of particular authors,
intended for more advanced students who are beginning
to read such authors as Terence, Plato, the Attic Dramatists,
and the harder parts of Cicero, Horace, Virgil, and
Thucydides,

These are provided with Introductions and Notes, but
no Vocabulary. The Publishers have been led to pro-
vide the more strictly Elementary Books with Vocabularies
by the representations of many teachers, who hold that be-
ginners do not understand the use of a Dictionary‚ and of
others who, in the case of middle-class schools where the
eost of books is a serious consideration, advocate the
Vocabulary system on grounds of economy. It is hoped
that the two parts of the SerieS, fitting into one another,
may together fulfil all the requirements of Elementary and
Preparatory Schools, and the Lower Forms of Public

Schools. b 2
