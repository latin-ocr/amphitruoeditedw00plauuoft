250 AMPHITRVO.

Zonyum, giving rise to lonqumsst : riremem lost one -em, and
became mrem, corrected to riyorem. The ships of war in
ancient times were long (μακραί), opposed to the tubby mer·
chant vessels (στρογγύλαι). Ussing reads tryqonem, from
Gertz’s emendation, comparing the galley to the stiny-ray.
The lembus was usually a small skiff ; but there was a kind of
lembi used in war. Curt. Rus. speaks of piratici lembi .· Livy,
24. 40, tells of lembi biremes, and although we do not read of
lembi triremes, the exaggeration suits the invention of the
slave.

De me hanc culpam de'molibor et seni faciam palam,

The second line is unmetrical. Ussing supplies ille before

metheus Liber, Frag. 12 (Oehler)‚ in tenebris ac suili vivunt:
nisi ‘nonforum hara, atque homines, Qui mmo plerique, sues sunt
existimandi.

BAccmmzs, 4. 4. 73.

Edax, nimis bellus atque ut esse maxime optabam locus.

After exclamations like eu, em, edepol, euax, Plautus uses the
accusative, not the nominative. Read therefore bellum...

locum, which at once sets the metre right.

Cusscmo, 1. 3. 4.

Eapse mgrgmtcondidicit bibere: foribus dat aquam quam
1 an .

The syllable -at of the present indicative, being the result
of a conti-action for ait, was originally long, and is generally
long in Plautus. Ritschl‚ Prol. Trin. p. 185, doubts however
whether dat was ever lengthened. I doubt whether dat was
