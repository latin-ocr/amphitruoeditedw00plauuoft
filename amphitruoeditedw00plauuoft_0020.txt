Amphitruo declares his intention of consulting the

From what Greek source Plautus borrowed The
Amphitruo is unknown. Sophocles wrote an Amphi-
tryon, but it was a tragedy : it was, it seems, copied by
Accius. Euripides wrote an Alcmena} a tragedy, of
which a large number of fragments have come down
to us, none in the least resembling any part of The
Amphitruo. Archippus a poet of the Old Comedy, who
lived at the end of the 5th century B.G., wrote a
comedy of the name, but there is nothing in our
Amphitruo of the character of the Old Comedy, nothing
at- 311 resembling the few fragments of Archippus's
play which have come down to us. The “Long
Night‘⁷ (νὺξ μακρά) of Plato Comicus is a title
which, as far as it goes, justifies the suggestion of
Casaubon that it may have been the original of our
Amphitruo, but there is no evidence forthcoming to
make this more than a suggestion. Some have sought
the source of the play in the ἱλαροτραγωδία or
φλυακογραφίσ. (burlesque) of the Sicilian Rhinthon,
who, we know from Athenaeus, wrote an A mplzz'tryon .-

Non ventus fuit, verum Alcumena Euripidi.
