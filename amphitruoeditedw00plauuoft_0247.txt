luce clara et candida: the only passage in Plautus where
lux is feminine ε it is masculine in Cape. 5. 4. 11, lucis tuendi ‚-

50. longior. The termination -oris invariably lengthened
in Plautus, when the genitive is —oria

51. disparem, ‘ that Ι may make an even distribution.
Desperare is a Plautine verb ; Rud. Prol. 10, Is izo-s· per yemis
alias αἷὶα disparat, where it is spoken of Jupiter arranging the
positions of the stars. The meaning of the passage, as Ι have
arranged it, is that in order to bring back the hours of dawn
and sunset to their proper place, Jupiter is obliged to shorten
the day by the time the previous night had been prolonged.
The passage is very much disputed. I have little doubt that
Ι am right in changing hac to haec, and in reading disparem ,-
but I am uncertain as to the rest of the passage. Ι formerly
wrote it thus 2-—

Atque quanto, nox, fuisti longior, haec proxima
Tanto brevior nox ut fiat faciam, ut aeque disparem,
Et die e nocte accedat.

According to this view the passage would mean that he would
shorten the next πὶςχήί, to compensate for the inordinate
lengthening of the past night. And this sense is much prefer-
able, but it involves the change of dies to nox. It is, however,
possible that dies was a correction of a transeriber, who thought
dies wanted to contrast with nox.

ΜΓ. Purser suggests placing a full stop at disparem, and

s reading En ! dies e nocte accedit J which seems feasible.

Acri* II. l.

Amphitruo, accompanied by Sosia, is on his way from the
harbour to his home. He has heard Sosia’s strange story of
his having been driven away from the house by his double,
and expostulates with him.
