IN ΤΕ OD UC'TION. xxi

E J are as inferior to B D as they are superior to
F Z.

F, Lipsiensis, a MS. of the 15th century, though it
claims the respect due to a MS. , is as a critical authority
not in any respect superior to an edition. It is full of
conjectures, many of them unnecessary and bad.

Z is the editio princeps (Venice, 1472). Its read-
ings, founded as they are on a worthless MS, F, are
quite devoid of critical value. I have called the
attention of the reader to the process of corruption
in our MSS. at 1. 1. 141: and no single example
can better illustrate the relative value of the MSS.

The characteristic errors of the MSS. have been
classified by Tyrrell, Pras. p. xxxi, xxxii. Ι would
add to his remarks that two remarkable features
of Plautine MSS. are (1) A proneness to insert or
to omit some small word, the insertion or omission
of which does not affect the sense. (2) A proneness
to transpose pairs of words. The reader will find
ample illustration of both of these tendencies in the
play.

PRosonY AND METRE.

The following remarks are not intended as a guide
to the whole subject of Plautine versification, but
only to such peculiarities as are exhibited in the
Amphitruo.
