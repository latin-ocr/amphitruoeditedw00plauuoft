words ' ; pro is here used as in such phrases as pro tua virtute,
etc„ ‘in keeping with your virtue.'

139. meticulosus: so somniculosus, febriculosus, pedzewlosvs.
The word occurs again, Most. 5. 1. 52, Nescis quam meticulosa
res sit ire acl indicem. aeque: this word, when joined to an
adjective, takes an ablative after it in Plautus, just as much as
the comparative degree does. Cure. 1. 2. 52, Qui me aeque
fortunatus erit? So adaeque, Oct-sin. 3. 5. 45, Neque est neque
fuit ‘me senex quisquam amator adaeque miser ; M ost. l. 1. 29,
Quo nemo adaeque iuventute ex omni Attica Antehac esc habitus
parcus, To these instances Ussing has added Pliny H ,Ν 35.
17, picturae quibus· equidem· nullas aeque demiror. It lnay be
thought that the phrase speculo claras, Most. 3. 1. 112, means
‘ as bright as a mirror,= aeque being implied. Langen, p. 18-
22, classifies the usages of aeque in Plautus.

140. denuo — detexere, ‘to weave over again,' i.e. to
eudgel me; for in weaving, the threads of the warp were
struck down with the shuttle. detexere is often used in the
sense of “to weave a west to its finish,'' i. q., pertexere. Cf.
Pseud. 2. 4. 7 :—

Neque exordiri primum, unde occipias, habes
Neque ad detexundam telam certos terminos.

Cf. also Incert. ap. Rhec. acl Herenn. 3. 26. 42, Nune esso te ab
summo iam detexcwn exordio. This is Ussing’s explanation. It
is difficult to 366 how the other explanation, ‘ 10 stea1,'
can be got out of detexere ,· the idea, however, 13 that when a
web 13 finished it 13 taken off the loom, 30 a coat stripped from
a person's back may be said detexi, and with this idea Leo
reads de umero for denuo of the MSS. I have unintentionally
printed Leo's reading (Ze umero in the text. I pray the reader
to substitute denuo for it.

141. pruriunt, ‘itch,' in expectation of a blow. Cf. Mil.
z} 53574, mihi domas· totus praru,- so Poen. 5. 5 36, Pers.

142. hospitio pugneo, ‘ a fisty welcome.' Cf. Eud. 3. 4.
58, Iam hercle tibi messe-s· in ore fiet ‘memis- pusstzeis, ‘ I’ll make·
hay in your face with fisty rakes,’ reminding us of the shrew’s
‘ I’ll comb your noddle with a three-legged stool. ’ For the form-
