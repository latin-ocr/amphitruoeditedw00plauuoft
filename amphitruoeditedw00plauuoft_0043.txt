which is unlikely3 in others the consecution of
dactyl and anapaest‚ Which is impossible.
Take for instance this line, Aul. 4. 5. 5 :

attat foris crepuit. senex eccum aurum ecfert foras.

In that trimeter if any one contends that the second
foot was to Plautus⁷s ear a proceleusmaticus and the
third a dactyl‚ I can only say σοὶ μὲν δοκείτω ταῦτ’,
ἐμοὶ δὲ θάτερα. I have said something on this sub-

the subject deserves a monograph.

METRE.

The Plautine iambic trimeter admits an
iambus, spondee, dactyI, anapaest‚ or tribrach, in every

the Terentia-n than the Plautine epoch.
