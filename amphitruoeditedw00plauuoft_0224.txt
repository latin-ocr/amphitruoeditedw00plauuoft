this is the only meaning superstitiosus· has in Plautus, who
uses the word three times: Cure. 3. 27, Superstitio-sm hic
quidemst: vera praedicat ; Επεὶ. 4. 4. 95, Quid si ista aut. super-
stitiosa aut ariolast atque omnia Quidquid insit vera dicet?
It is likely that superstitiosus meant a person who believed
in ghosts, a person who was conversaut with ghosts, a person
who could raise a ghost, a necromancer, diviner. So Mayor

Phil. 271, ἐκ πολλοῦ σάλου. ut vectus huc sum, i.e. ‘having
sailed hither '; lit.‚ ‘ in accordance with the fact that I sailed
hither.’ Ussing prefers taking ut z postquam, and he may be
right, but see note on ut iacui, 5. 1. 15, and compare Bacch.
1. 1. 73, ut iu navi vecta es, credo, timida es, where the mean-

ing ‘ since ’ is out of place.

176. inanis, ‘ empty handed ' ε As. 3. 3. 70. cum onere : cf.
Poen. 4. 2. 30, Haud amice facis qui eum onere affers moram,
a strange elliptical expression for onus portanti.
