110. iterum z the first time was at vs. 87. iam hic in : this
is an anapaest 3 iam, unelided in the first syllable of a resolved
arsis 3 hic, short as usual. inclementer dicit, ‘ speaks rudely.’
Pseud. 1. 1. 25, Cur inclementer dicis lepidi-s· litteris? Rucl. 1.
2. 26, Aut qui inclementer dicat homini libem,- cf. Rud. 3. 4.
293 Truc. 2. 7. 44. sine malo, ‘without being punished for
it,' cf. 89 supra.

111. Tace tu (Sosia). tu dic (Alcumena).

112. Ah ἰ very osten begins a speaker’s words at the end of

atline: see Ter. Plzorm. 5. 3. 26: And. 5. 3. l : Ad. 1. 2. 32,

113. etiam id tu sciS, ‘do you actually know that?' Cf.
141 infra, etiam id credis, ‘ do you actually believe that?'

quippe qui ε ‘ why, you told me yourself.' See note on 73
supra.

114. expugnavisses occideriS, ‘ how you had stormed and
how you slew.’ Both these tenses are of course legitimate,
and the variation is Plautine. See notes on 1. 2. 25, Ρνοῑ. 74.

117. roga forms a pyrrhic, as many dissyllabic imperatives
in Plautus and Terence owing to the influence of the verbal
and metrical accent, as mane, cave, abi, redi, vola, ama. Puta
remained a pyrrhic in the best age, as Pers. 4. 9, Hoc puta
non iustum est. The scansion Ηάηο φορά. Me quidem prae-
sente is not possible. Luchs has clearly shown that the accent
never falls on the first syllable of quidem in trochaic verses in
Plautus, and in iambic trimeters only when it is in the first
foot 3 in iambic septena-rii in the fifth foot also.

118. mirum quin. An ironical phrase. of frequent occur·
rence. ‘ It 's a wonder he won’t contradict his master. ' mirum
quin and mirum ni (or 7722'7·a.3u71t⁷zz') are both common in Plautus,
but their usages are quite different: mirum m‘ or mira ni
states a supposition which would account for a given state of

facts ; ‘ it's a wonder if such a state of things is not the case.'
