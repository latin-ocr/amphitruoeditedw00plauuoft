INTRODUCTION.

THE plot of lee Amphitruo is, or rather was, as
follows. Amphitruo and his newly-married wife are
resident in Thebes.1 Creon, the king of Thebes, has
given Amphitruo the command of his army against
the piratical Teleboae. Amphitruo departs leaving

1 The play assigns no cause for Amphitruo’s residence at
Thebes, nor does this concern the plot in any way. Apollo-
dorus (Bibl. 2. 48) narrates that Amphitryon had accidentally
slain Electryon, the father of his betrothed wife Alcmena, and
had fied ‘to Thebes, where Creon was reigning. Hence, he
tells us, Amphitryon led an expedition against the Teleboae, to
take vengeance on their king, Pterelaus, who had killed
Alcmena’s brother. This differs from the play which repre-
sents Amphitruo merely as Creon's general against the Tele-
boae, and the quarrel with them, apparently, as Creon’s
quarrel. The play differs from Apollodorus in other respects
also. The latter represents the night 35 three times its ordin·
ary length: Plautus simply as somewhat longer. According
to Apollodorus, Hercules was eight months old when he
strangled the serpents z Plautus represents him as just born.
Apollodorus represents Amphitryon to have consulted the seer
Tiresias, and to have been reconciled to his wife by his assur-
ance that it was Jupiter who had visited her. In the play

Jupiter himself explains everything.
