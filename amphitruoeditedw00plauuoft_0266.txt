puero; on the words, yravidam imperiis, he writes, Sic
Plautus in Amphitruone: uxor tua uon puero sed peste yravida
est) See Note on quod, 1. 3. 7 supra. As to the long final
syllable of mitur, it is either lengthened owing to the strong
stop caused by the change of speakers, which was Ritschl’s
view, or else the passage is corrupt. There is no support for
the view that the syllable was really long in Plautus.

89. malum, ‘thrashing’ Malum often in Plautus means
the punishment of slaves: for the pronunciation cf. vs. 71
supra. Such a remark as Sosia's was calculated to awaken
the wrath of a woman in Alcumena’s case.

91. Sosia retorts on his mistress. But not daring to say
openly that she deserved malum, a thrashing‚ he turns it off
by saying that she, as a pregnant woman, ought to get malum,
an apple, to eat when she feels sick. But it is very doubtful
whether the verse can stand as it appears in the MSS. Allowing
that chZ um may denote ‘ the pleasing punishment that women
bear,’ oportet is not rightly joined to mellum duri, and mlum
jars with an imo male esse occeperit in the next verse. I do not
think any of the suggestions mentioned in the Critical Note are
likely. Perhaps,

Enimvero praegnati oportet et malum et malvam dari.

Mallows were a wholesome fcod with medicinal effect. Hor.

92. animo si male esse occeperit, ‘ if she begins to feel sick.’
Animo male esse is a common phrase, cf. 5. 16. It seems to
have especially denoted, to feel sick in the stomach. Pseud.

97. ted ibi, ‘ when first did you notice that you began to be
affected by it?' viz., by black bile. For implicari, of being
caught in diseases, cf. Mart. 1. 79. 2, Ureret implicitum cum
scelerata lues ,· Lucr. 6, 1232, Implicitam morbo ; Liv, 2. 3.
