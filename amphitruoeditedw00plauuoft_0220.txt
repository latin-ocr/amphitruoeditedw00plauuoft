158 AMPHITRVO. Aer 1.

144. dormiam, as dead, or stunned3 κοιμᾶσθαι (whence
cemetery) often meant ‘to die’ 111 late Greek3 and sopitus
is the usual word for ‘ stunned’ in Livy.

145. oppido, ⁶ utterly,' ‘ quite ’ z (κομιδῇ), rather a favourite
adverb with Plautus, used both with verbs and 11011115. It is
supposed to :plane .· oppidum being said to be connected with
ob-pcclzcm (πέδον), but it is very doubtful.

146. hic. The nom. masc. is generally short in Plautus,
and Luchs has written a tract to prove that it is always so.
Four or five passages at least rebel, and it is very difficult to
emend the passage before us to suit 1ιῖ0. For ut hic and sic
do not suit auscultet ; auscultare means ‘to listen,' not ‘to
hear ' (cf. Varro L. L. 6. 83, who quotes from an old poet, audio
haud ausculto), and hic auscultet means ‘let him list-ens
equivalent to 1100 auscultante. The other passages where

11ἰο 15 long are—

Cape. 3. 4. 15: ι
Hegio hic 1101110 rabiosus habitus est in Alide,

where Luchs would either suppose hiatus after Hegio (and we
find similar hiatus after Amphitruo in this play, see Index),
or else read istic for hic.

Cam* L lNigc hic occepit quaestum hunc fili gratia,

where, as Seyffert points out, hic cannot be the adverb.

Cure. 5. 3. 38:
Libera haec est, hic huius frater est haec autem huius est

SOI'OI'.

Pers. 5. 2. 50:
Tace stulte: hic eius geminust frater. Hicinest? Ac gemin-

issimus.

These last two instances might be got over without changing
the MSS. if we allowed huius and eiu->- 10 1)0 pyrrhics, but the
evidence in favour of this in Plautus is very weak. There is
no certain instance of 11ἲο 111 1110 Fragments of the Latin
Scenic PoetS‚ nor in Ennius; but there are two instances of
11ῑο 111 1110 Fragments of Lucilius, and none of 11ἴο.

147. modum in maiorem. The phrase in maiorem mod-nm,
or maiorem in modum, is frequent in Cicero, especially 111
