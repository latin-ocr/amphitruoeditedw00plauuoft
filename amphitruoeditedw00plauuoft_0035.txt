I NT ROD UOTION. xxix

The Amphitruo has no test case 3 nor of -at in the
present subjunctive, nor of -et in t-he future, or im-
perfect subjunctive, but both these terminations seem
to have been long, see Mueller, p. 65, 66.

Amph. Prol. 102 is no proof of the lengthening
of the final syllable of ipsemet. See note on 1. 1.
191.

-iS in verbs generally had the normal quantity5
but in Amph. 2. 1. 5 we find:

Facis ut tuis nulla apud te fides sit.

Here facis tu is generally read3 but as this is
bacchiac metre, in which Plautus seems to have
liked to keep the original long quantity of verbal
syllables ending in -t, owing to the strong ictus,
Spengel may be right in adhering to the MSSâ€ž but I
do not think he is.

ais is not considered an exception: this is sup-
posed to point to an old fourth conjugation.

-ib is long in the third singular present of the fourth
conjugation: as it from eo. This was originally eit, and
traces of this form are found in the MSS. I have in-
troduced it, Amph. 1. 3, 35:

Tempus it: exire ex urbe priusquam lucescat volo.

So also in the compounds exit, adit, deperit.
-it is also sometimes long in the third singular of
the perfect. Amph. 2. 2. 11:

Vicit et domum laudis compos revenit.
