226 AMPHITRVO. Aer 111.

Milphio, heus, ubi es? ΜΙ. Assum apud te eccum. AG. At
ego elixus sis volo.

2. It is safest to insert sosia. before optume with Leo. But
Ι am very much inclined to think it should be inserted after
advems. Sosia might have fallen out before Sos. iam.
This division of the anapaest would be in ordinary words
illegitimate, but proper names were to a great extent legibus
solutae in respect of these metrieal niceties.

3. volup est, ‘it is pleasing.' The uss. here give volupe est,
but Ritschl (Opusc. 450) will only admit the form volup, which
occurs at the end of lines, Asin. Caterva, 1; Cas. 4. 2. 5;
Most. 1. 2. 74; Mero. 4. 3. 3. In all the other passages it is
in the phrase volup est, which might easily be changed to
volupe est, and yet is only so changed here and in Rud. 4. 4.
132 (B); Rud. 4. 1. 1 (C). volup is an adverb, the opposite
of aegre. Mil. 3. 1. 152, Sa· illzs aessrest mihi quod volup est.

9. An id ioco. Id 1s shortened, a short accented monosy-l
lable preceding. vero, ‘in sober earnest)

10. Habui expurigationem, ‘I have made an apology.’
Habui seems used as in such phrases as habere orationem, ‘to
deliveraspeechss habere sermonem, haberer luerelam. It could
noc mean (Ι have received forgivenessss expuryo being in
Plautus invariably used of the accused person clearing

himself.

11. vota quae sunt. The antecedent is suppressed‚ as is
common in Plautus. (Ι will make an offering within (with
those οΗ61111ς5,ἱῖ,7ἰ-5·,) which Ι 1701176ᾶῇ See Note 011 Ρνοῖ. 106.
Brix takes it as a construction κατὰ σύνεσιν, (Ι will offer the

offerings I 1 owed)
censeo, (Ι think you had best? For a play on the

different uses of cen-seo, cf. Rud. 4. 8. 5 seqq .·
