I NTR OD U ΟΤΙ ON. xxv

examination of this point is, however, beyond the
limits of the present work. In The Amphitruo two
apparent, but only apparent, instances of 695 occur.

1. 1. 45:

Nam quom pugnabant maxume, ego fugiebam maxume.

Here tum 'should be inserted after eqo with the
second hand of B. In 2. 1. 56:

Neque lac laetis magis est simile, quam ille ego similist inei

the aecentuation, without lengthening, of (296 is per-
feetly legitimate. Fleckeisen's similis est is obvious,
but unneoessary. In 2. 1. 53 a slight transposition
gets rid of eyemet.

-ar. The verbal ending -avr is always long in Plau-
tus: loquar, Prol. 383 2. 1. 93 opprimar, 5. 1. 4.

-er. The verba] ending -er is not established by any
passage in Plautus. It should, however, be long by
analogy‚ the second person being -ἑγὶε,

The termination —er is in all other cases short.
Iuppiter in Prol. 94 is only an apparent exception, see
note on 1. 1. 190.

-0r. The verbal ending -or in the first eonjugation
is invariably long: machinor astutiam, Capi. 3. 3. 15. T he
Amphitruo has no instance. The ending —or in the
other conjugations is more doubtful ε Mueller holds it
to be long.
