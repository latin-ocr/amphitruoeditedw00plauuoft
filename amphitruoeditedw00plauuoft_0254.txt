trite w υ - —-. Cf. for instance Aesch. Prom. 397 seqq.
(6.9. νοτίοις ἔτεγξα παγαῖς), Eur. Bacch. 519 seqq. (e.9. σὺ δέ μ’
ὦ μάκαιρα Δίρκα), Ar. Han. 344 seqq. (6.9. φλογὶ φέγγεται δὲ
λείμων). This was a favourite metre with Varro; ancl
Catullus wrote the whole Attis in what is practically the
same metre, viz. the Galliambic. homimum. This form,
necessary here to complete the Bacchius, is testified by
Priscian, 683, vetustissimi etiam homo Immonis declina·
verunt. He cites Ennius (183 Mueller) :

Volturus in spinis miserum mandebat homonem,

in which passage the MSS. of Charisius give hominem. This
declension will be found to remedy many passages in Plautus,
and Leo appears quite right in introducing it here. Brix has
often introduced it in the pla-ys edited by him. The only
passage in Ribbeck’s edition of the comio fragments where it
appears is in Novius, Τ οῃαῖανὶα (88 Ribb.) 2——

Abite, deturbate saxo, homonum quisquiliae ! Quid est?

where the MSS. of Festus give homo non. This, as well as the
scansion, points to Ribbeck's conjecture. ’

3. ita dis est placitum Mss„ which Spengel and Brix
retain, scanning 2·th .· ita divis est placitum, Leo, who with
Mueller rejects that scansion. I hope the reader will not
expect me to decide finally points like these where excellent
scholars differ. By reading divis I have ranged myself on
Mueller's side, who holds that all the passages where the MSS.
exhibit ith are false readings. They are not few; a list is
given in Mueller's Plant. Prol. p. 14. In all of these, however,
where ita is an Iambus, the text is probably corrupt, and is
capable of easy emendation 3 for instance, no one would think
of quoting Asin. 1. 1. 3 to support ἱίᾶ .· I ta te obtestor per senec-
tutem tuam, where ted has long since been introduced. The
only passage where ita probably was written as an Iambus is

Cist. Ary. 10 :—
Itaque lege et rite civem cognitam,

but written, not by Plautus, but by the author of an Argu-
ment, who, misled by false readings, thought he was justified
in making Plautus write ith. Brix on Cape. 3. 2. 3 allows ita
in Bacchiae and Cretic metres, but Mueller shows there is no
ground for this distinction. For clivi cf. 5. 1. 69: Aul. l. l. ll.
