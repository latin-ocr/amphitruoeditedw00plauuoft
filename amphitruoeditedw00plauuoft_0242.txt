180 AMPHITRVO. AOT Ι.

(Ribb.), Quid tibi aucupatio est Aryumentum, aut de meo
amore verbificatio est patri ἒ

It will be noticed that iu al] these passages the verbal is in-
troduced by quidest, and the sentence invariably means
‘ what business have you to do so and so ‘2’ But in Capt. 3. 3. 4,
Neque exitium exitiost, ‘ there is no getting avvay from destruc·
tion‚’ the usage is different, there being no question, though
there is in the other passage, where the nom. exitio is used,
Truc. 2. 6. 30, Quid illi ex *utero exitio est? Stich. 2. 1. 9 is
another exception: Quae miseri in expectatione& Epiqnomi
adventum viri.

22. The insertion of the second iam belongs to Spengel,
Plaut. p. 2263 it is adopted by Ussing. I overlooked this
when writing my Critieal Note. Nor is it necessary to read
quoiei, as quoi is legitimately in hiatus, being a monosyllable in
the first foot of a resolved arsis.

The aposiopesis is not caused by the intervention of Alcu-
mena, but is caused by the fact that Jupiter is about to
substitute action for word, and bring his staff down on
Mercury. It is also helped by the fact that an aposiopesis is
usual with threats. Virgil's (Aen. 1. 135) Quos eyo...sed motos
praestat componere fluctus is well known. Conington there
adds Ter. And. 1. 1. 137, Quem quidem eqo si sensero sed
quid opus· ast verbis? Ov. Her. 12. 207, Quos equidem actutum
sed qnid praedicere poenam Attinet ..

1 Ιῖῐιιξῒὲὶπο modo, ‘only dare to say one word) See Note on
. .·.·7.

23. nequiter, ‘poorly,’ expedivit, ‘turned out‚' intransi-
tive, as Prol. 5, where see Note. paene, not a litotes for
prorsus, as Ussing says. There is a litotes in nequiter, none
in paene.- he nearly came off poorly, in that he narrowly
escaped having his head broken.

24. verum: resumptive like sed, 5. 1. 58. quod: ‘ touching
the matter you spoke of.’ This accusative pendeus is very
common in the comio writers and in Cicero’s Letters. See

Roby, vol. 2. ἓ 1749.

25. clanculum, ‘ on the sly,' a comio adverb: also as preposi-
tion‚ clanculum patres, Ter. Ad. 1. l. 27. legione, Prol. 133.
subrupui, ‘ Ι stole this service for you ' (subripio, of which the
old form was subi-apio).
