APPENDIX II.

POENULUS, 1. 2. 31.

Soror cogita amabo item nos perhiberi
Quasi salsa muriatica esse autumantur
Sine omni lepore et † sine suavitate.

The metre is Bacchiae. without touching on the corrup-
tions in the first two verses, it may be remarked that the
third should run ε

Sine omni lepore et suavi suavitate.

Compare· Pseud. 3. 2. 9, cenam conditam clato Hodie atque
suavi suavitate concliam.

RUDENS, 3. 6. 21.

PLEs. Ego hunc scelestum in ius rapiam exulem.
Age, ambula in ius.

Plesidippus states his intention of dragging Labrax into
court, to force him to make formal restitution of Palaestra
and Ampelisca whom he had carried off. Such an action in
Greek would be called ἐξούλης δίκη. Harpocration, p. 75. 23,
ἐξούλης ὄνομα δίκης ἣν ἐπάγουσιν οἱ φάσκοντες ἐξείργεσθαι τῶν ἰδίων
κατὰ τῶν ἐξειργόντων. No words could describe the case of
Plesidippus vs. Labrax more accurately. Harpocration refers
to the Ποάστριαι of the comio poet Phrynichus for the word
ἐξούλης. Aristides, 2. 133, quoted by Kock‚ Fray. Com.
Graec„ vol. 3, p. 524, has the remarkable words, εἰ δεῖ καὶ
μῦθον λέγειν δέδοικα ἐγὼ μὴ καὶ ταῖς ’γραῦσιν ἐξούλης ὀφλεῖν φῇ τις
ἀνὴρ κωμικῶς meaning ‘old women will sue us for wrongful
possession if we tell stories.' Plautus not uncommonly trans-
literates technical Greek terms ε so he has anancaeo, Rud. 2.
3. 33. dica (abl. of dica, ‘an action') may have fallen out
at the end of the line under -dz'am which ends the previous
line. I propose to write

Ego hiinc scelestum in ifis rapiam ἐξούλης dica.

TRIN. 2. 4. 196 seqq.

Effugiet ex urbe, ubi erunt factae nuptiae ε
Ibit †istac aliquo in maxumam malam crucem
Latrocinatum‚ aut in Asiam aut in Ciliciam.

No remedy for the deep corruption in istac has been found.
