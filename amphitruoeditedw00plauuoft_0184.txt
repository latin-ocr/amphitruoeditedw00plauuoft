the authorship of the five Acrostich Arguments. (On the
question see Ritschl's Prol. Triu. 316 sqq. and his Parerqa,
vol. 2.)

Ritschl remarks generally of the metrical skill shown in the
composition of the Arguments: cum proloslis non Plautinis hoc
ii commune habent quod sss-orsus Plautina numerorum arte facti
sunt (Prol. Triu. p. 316). And again, apage illorum inertiam,
qui quod in Plauto vix sint toleraturi imputare tamen arqu-
mentis Plautinis uon vereantur. These remarks certainly go too
far. No doubt the imitators of Plautus did their best to ob-
serve his rules. But they could not, and certainly did not
thoroughly apprehend those rules. Nor did the author of the
Prologues, although his composition will bear a stricter
scrutiny than that of the authors of the Arguments. Both the
Prologues and the Argummts, however, come near, though
they do not quite attain to the precision of their model, and
the wonder is that their mistakes are so few, not that they
are so many.

Ritschl asks z why not emend the violations of law found in
the Arguments when you will emend Plautus himself ‘2 The
answer is that the faults in the Arguments are more numerous
in proportion than those in the text of Plautus: that they belong
to certain classes as (l) false quantitieS‚ see Crit. Note on Ary.
l. 33 (2) freer use of hiatus than Plautus himself permitted
(especially in the Acrostioh Arguments) ; (3) non-observance
of metrical niceties: for instance a dactyl precedes an anapaest,
Cis-t. Arq. 1 ; (4) inistaken views on points of Plautine
scansion, as Itaque, Cist. Arg). 11. The Arguments and the
Prologues should be emended so far as to bring them within
the general rules of the Iambic metre z to force Plautus's own
special rules on them would resultin producing something
quite different from what the authors wrote.

 

ARGUMENT 1.

1. Amphitruonis: Although the Mss. do not preserve this
form, the writer of the Acrostich Argument makes the eighth
letter to be u: and although, as Ussing suggests, he may
have been compelled to do this by the fact that no Latin
word begins with y, yet it is probable that Amphitruo, or per-
haps Amfitruo, was the true Plautine form. The ancient
