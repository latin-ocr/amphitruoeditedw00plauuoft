170 AMPHITRVO. Aer 1.

250. hac noctu: supra, vs. 118. ex portu Persico: the
portae Persaeus must be a harbour in, near, 01· 011 the way
home from the islands of the Teleboae, whence Amphitruo and
’ Sosia sailed back to the harbour of Thebes. Festump 2.1,7
says. Pe? szczcm portum Plautus cum ait, mare Eubozcum videtu)
sigynz'ficare, quod in eo clas-928 Persarum dicitur stetisse non
procul a Thebis, and Plautus may have meant some harbour
in the Euripus, which he, regardless of the anachronism,
calls portus Persicus. in portum, which Ι have inserted,
means ‘into harbour,’ ele. into the harbour, which Plautus,
careless of geography, gave to Thebes. In portu may have
fallen out easily before ex portu. Huc which is usually inserted
to fill up the lacuna would scarcely be right, for huc in the
next line means the very place they are now standing, and the
ship had not brought them thither. Cf. Pers. 4. 4 U⁹23: nam
heri in 2907 tum noctu navis zenit.

252.11011116; the view now generally obtaining is that
Spengel’s statement that Plautus did not use nonne is not
proved. It is, however, likely that he wrote 77077. med here,
and that he only used nonne before vowels. We must, how-
ever, be content with uncertainty on this as many other
points of Plautine lore. As a rule the meaning of nonne is
expressed by 77077, by -776 (as sumne autem nihili? Bacch. l.
1. 89, or by satin as 2. 2. 1.

257. Amphitruonis sum: 8 is elided, or dropped in pronuncia-
tion, as often in Plautus and the old writers. This is common in
Lucretius, once in Catullus. W'hen Ussing states on vs. 190

others where aphaeresis of 8 is admitted. The following
instances in Terence will be sufficient :—N ullus sum, And. 3.
