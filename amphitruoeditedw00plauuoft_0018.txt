xii AMPHJTRVO

his wife pregnant. During his absence Jupiter be-
comes enamoured of Alcumena, and assumes the guise
of Amphitruo, Mercury at the same time taking the
dress and form of Amphitruo's slave, Sosia. Jupiter
visits Alcumena, pretending that he has returned from
the conquest of the Teleboae, tells her how he has
slain their king, Pterelaus, with his own hand, and
presents her with the golden goblet of Pterelaus.
At the same time the night is preternaturally
lengthened. Amphitruo having conquered the TeleÎ‡
boae, and returned by ship to the harbour of ThebeS,
sends Sosia forward at night to his house to give
Alcumena tidings of his safe arrival. Sosia finds Mer-
cury on the watch, and is driven away by him.
Sosia returns to the harbour to his master, and tells
him of his strange encounter with his second self,
and how he was prevented coming near the house.
Master and man set out together for the house of the
former. Jupiter, as day is on the point of breaking,
has just said farewell to Alcumena, and quitted the
house. Amphitruo, to his wife's amazement, salutes
her as though he had been long absent, and is
thoroughly mystified by her assertion that he had
spent the night with her. He is convinced of her
infidelity, announces his intention of divorcing her,
and determines to appeal to Naucrates, a relation of
his wife and his fellow-passenger, whether her asser-
tion is not utterly false.
