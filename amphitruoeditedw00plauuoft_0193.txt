PROL. ἢ NOTES (Ξῖ-46). 133

praeqnatis facit (i.e. ex iis quas). Ibid. 3. 1. 98, on which
passage see Tyrrell's notes.

41-45. Ussing first pointed out the true construction, which
is sufficiently indicated by the punctuation. He did not, how-
ever, think it necessary to change omuibus although he saw
that it was masc. and must be separate-i from benefactis. He
writes: cur eqo, inquit, aliorum exempla sequar ut et ipse
enumerem quoru-m beneficiorum Iuppiter omuibus hominibus
auctor sit? I think hominibus is necessary, and omnibu-s

unneceSS’dI'y.

42. Virtutem Victoriam. The temples of these goddesses are
mentioned with others by Cicero N. D. 2. 2. 23. quis bene-
factis = quibus benefactis. This is a possessive dative, equivalent
to a genitive. Ussing quotes illo-st. 1. 2. 9, ei rei arssumeuta
dim-[m ; T rin. 1. Ξ. 167, illorum verbis· salsi-3 acceptor fui :
Asin. 2. 4. 20 (Mil. 3. l. 140 is mistaken by both Lambinus
and Ussing). The difference between such datives and those
used in the best aye in a sense scarcely (listinguishable from a
genitive, is that the latter refer to person-3, not things-s. See
Roby's list, Lat. Gram. part 2. p. 6⁶2. Horace, Sat. l. 6. 71, re·
produces this idiom : causafuz't pater Izi-5,- as he reproduces
many other colloquial idioms in his satires.

45. architectus. Plautus uses both the incorrectly Latin-
ized form architectus as well as architecton. Similar adapta-
tions of Greek names in -ων are Purpureus for Porphyrion in
Naevius : Tranius as equivalent to Tranio in the Mostellaria
(3. 1. 33); Electrus or Electrius for Εἶπέν-9οη 99 infra:
Alcmeus or Alcumeus for Alcmaeon (Ἀλκμέων) Capt. 3. 4. 30,
etc. Cicero often uses architectus (which is the only form
he uses) metaphorically, as De Fin. 1, 10, Ab illo inventore
veritatis, et quasi architecto beatae ¹ritae. Lambinus suggests
that the actor who acted the part of Jupiter may have been a
builder.

46. patri meo optumo : it is all but certain the line did not
end with patri meo. It is a most rigid law that neither a
trimeter or a trochaic septenarius may end with two Iambic
words, or with an Iambic word preceded by a word ending in
an Iambus. This rule was well known to the Prologue
writers and Argument writers, ancl they never offend against
it. In the case before us the line was incomplete, and optumo
