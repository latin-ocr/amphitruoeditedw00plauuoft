168 AMPHITRVO. Aer 1.

222. pro fidem! ‘Help, help ξ’ Properly ‘I appeal to your
honour, citizens of Thebes.' Etiam clamas. Etiam is not, Ι
think, ‘ also,' but ‘ actually,’ an intensive meaning it often has
in Plautus ; 215 supra. ‘ Oh, you'll shout, will you 1’

224. istoc, on that account, i.e. for saying that.

227. Etiam mutus, ‘ are you still daring to mutter? ’ M αἰτίη
ε submissa voce loqui, 80, of course, stronger than if Mercury
had merely said loqueris. Etiam, ‘ still‚' a common usage in
Plautus, 215 supra.

228. vocare. Plautus much prefers the form in -re to that
in -ντῖς, 190 supra.

229. peccaveram, ‘ Ι made a mistake.' pecco is often used
of verbal slips. Bacch. 3. 3. 29, Cum librum leyeres si unam
peccavisses syllabam ,· Cas. 2. 6. 18, Per pol saepe peccas. The
use of the pluperfect for a perfect or imperfect is common in
Plautus, and, like many Plautino features, reappears in
Propertius. In Most. 3. 2. 136 a point is made from the double
meaning of empti fuerant .· see Sonnenschein ad loc.

230. Nam Amphitruonis socium sane me esse volui dicere,
‘I certainly meant to say I was Amphitruo’s comrade.'
Sosia plays on the similarity of sound of socium and
Sosiam. This passage has always been a stumbling block to
those who hold it absolutely certain that c was pronounced
exactly as k. The Bishop of Salisbury. Fraq. and Spec. p.
28, says this “play on Sosiam and socium may well be
excused in the Umbrian Plautus‚'' the Umbrians having em-
ployed a soft-sounding letter to represent c before e and i.
Bishop Wordsworth adds that s was employed by the
Volscians, eg. >fensio. =faciat, and *he quotes as an instance
outside Umbria the word Losna on a mirror found at Praeneste,
where Losna stands for Laena, Lucina, Luna, the moon.

For the MS. reading and suggestions of this much disputed
verse, see Crit. Note. Sane for ne seems to me the simplest
correction. Sane volo is of frequent occurrence. Cic. Fam. 3.
5, sane vellem potuisset obsequi voluntati tuae ‚· Ter. Heant. 4.
8. 31, sane z·0Z0,· Id. Ad. 5. 1. 13, saue nollem huc exitum,-
Trin. 1. 2. 20, sane velim.

232. fugit te ratio, ‘ you made a slip‚’prop. ‘a slip in adding
up accounts. ' It was a common colloquialism. Catull. 10. 29:-
