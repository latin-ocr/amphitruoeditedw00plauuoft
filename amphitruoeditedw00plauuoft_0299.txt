when he is a little crazed. The idea is the same in sartam*
For a fine metaphorical use of sarta tecta cf. Trin. 2. 2. 36 t

Sarta tecta tua praecepta usque habui mea modestia.
30. etiam nunc, ‘ once more,’ μάλ’ αὖθις.

33. tu idem: idem, as often used of a change in the same
person z of inconsistency.

40. puerperae is nominative to solent, not dative after it.
Ussing was the first to point out the true construction, which
is sufficiently obvious. Of. vs. 9 supra.

42. capite operto. In solemn prayers to the gods the
Romans covered their heads. Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 37, cum vellem
mittere operto Me capite in flumen, of a person about to devote
himself to death. The custom was emblematic of the unseen
world, and in it appears the more spiritual nature of the
Romans.

45. absolvito, properly ‘pay me off‚' then ‘let 1116 go,' ‘ dis·
miss me.’ lllosc. 3. 2. 151, omnino ut te absolvam, nullam
pictam conspicio hic avem ; Epid. 3. 4. 30, te absolvam brevi.

47. quisquam, if masc., is used as a general expression;
but quisquam in the old drama was often used With feminines,
even in the accusative quemquam (Eud. 2. 3. 75, anum quem-
quam, Most. 3. 1. 78, beluam quemquam), so also quis, quisquc,
quisquis, and quispiam. See Brix’s note on Tria. 2. 4. 8,
quis seems to have been originally of only two terminations.

52. incunabulis, ‘ swaddling clothes ' (σπάργανα) tied tightly
round the new-born babe. Truc. 892, Fasciis opus est pinli-inis,
cunis, incunabulis. colligare, ἐντυλίσσειν.

54. non metuo, equivalent to non dubito, hence quin.

56. iubati, ‘ crested snakes‚' a fabulous invention according
to Pliny, 11. 122 (quoted by Ussing), but often mentioned as
pffiqgiilggus, Liv. 13. 4, Virg. Aen. 2. 206, Eur. Phoen. 206

*Mn Purser suggests siccam in preference to sartam. This is an
excellent conjecture. and suits sae-cam of B as well or better than sartam ,-
but saroam of D seems to me to be clearly sartam. Mr. Purser remarks
that siccus is often ioined with sanus: as Afr. 61 (Ribb.) sicca, sana,
sobria: Cic. de opt. qen. orat. 3, sanis et siccis. Id. Brut. 2023 cf. Sen,
Ep. 114. 3. Cic. Acad. 2. ap. Non. p. 394. Still I prefer sartam, as suit-
ing the tradition of the mss. saroam, saccam better, and I am not quite

sure of this use of siccus applied to mens.
