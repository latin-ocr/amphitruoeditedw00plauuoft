‚qnam mea lca-slinmst potita, and ibid. 35. This idiom does not
seem to be the same as that by which potior, ‘ to own,’ is used
even of bad things: mortem, Gell. 13. 1; quid mali, Ter.
Pleorm. 3. 1. 5 3 fnqae potiti, As. 3. 2. 9, might be explained
either way, as ‘mortis leliqua potitum, Lucr. 4. 776. For the
active form cf. Rud. 4. 2. 6, piscatu noco me uberi compotivit.
Eut it has been proposed, I cannot remember where or by
whom, to take potire and potiri, when used of bad things,
as hostiam, etc., as a sort of irony, ‘has caught hold of the
enemy,' meaning ‘ the enemy has caught hold of him.’ But I

‹loubt this view.

25. quiritat, ‘is loudly complaining.' This verb, which
Nonius derived from Quirites, ‘to appeal to the citizens,' is
said in some glossaries to denote the voice of the pig, and this
derivation is accepted apparently by Varro, who includes it
among verbs, ab animalium vocibus tralata in homines, L. L. 7.
Sl ; and Arist. Car-m. Pln‘lom. 55, has Qw'rrzfat verres, pardus
rudit, oncat asellus. But there is no doubt that the Romans
themselves commonly connected it with Quirites and used
it in the sense of ‘protesting‚' ‘ complaining.' Our ‘cry' is
derived from it through Italian [[νῐζίανθ, French erier. It is
found in Lucilius, 200 ζ L), where it is joined with rudet and
viulitabit, and who makes the first syllable short3 in Livy, in
Asinius Pollio ap. Cio„ and several times in Apuleius. In
Liv. 39. 8, nulla vvove quirz'tantz'mn inter stupra et caedes eaeaucliri
poterat, it is used of people screaming in agonising pain or
alarm, and so by Pollio ap. Cic. Fam. 10. 32, ille misero
quiritanti civis Romanus sum. But in Apuleius, 8. 156, 5. 107,
it is not distinguishable in sense from queror, and in Mss. it is
often misspelt querito, whence the corruption queritur here.

26. vero, ‘of a truth.' verna, ‘a born slave'3 the word,
as we gather from Nonius’s note on the previous verse, im-
plied reproach. See Crit. Note.

numero, ‘ too soon.' The meaning is this. Sosia, on
his arrival at the harbour, had returned thanks, or had
thought of returning thanks, to the gods for his safe return.
He says he was too hasty about it, having this perilous errand
still before him. Cf. Afranius 312, M e miseram! numero ac
nequiquam eyi qratiam, whence it would seem the phrase
numero aqere qratia-s· was a common one, equivalent to holloa·
