51. dudum, ‘just now‚' ‘ a short while ago.’

53. proinde quasi, ‘just as if) Proinde is much more com-
mon than perinde in this sense in Plautus. It is always a
dissyllable in Plautus, and proin, which is a shortened form, is
always a monosyllable. He most commonly joins it with ut:
twice with qua-si, here, and Poen. 4. 2. 23: once with (fliam,
Truc. 2. 3. 3: twice according to the Palatine MSS. with ac,

after‚' i. e. as though it were long since you had seen me.

reclusit, Cast. 4. 43 recidit, Poen. 5. 6. 32; perhaps reveniunt,
1. 1. 33 supra. This archaic lengthening was preserved in the
best ages in the case of recido and reduco, which were perhaps
written (by the later authors) reccido and redduco, a doubling
often preserved 1n the MSS. See Munro on Lucretius, 1. 228,
who, when he says ‘ Plautus and Terence have always reclduco,'
