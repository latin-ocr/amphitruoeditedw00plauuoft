150. duro sopori, ‘hard sleep‚' i.e. the sleep 01⁸ death, so
called, probably, with reference to the rigidity of the body in
the sleep of death, as well as to the discomfort of a hard bed,
cf. Virg. Aen. 10. 745:

Olli dura quies oculos et ferreus urget
Somnus.

And so Aen. 12. 309. In Prop. 1. 18. 28 we have the literal
sense, Et (latur invidio tramite dura quie-3,- and in Prop. 1. 16.
⁴22, Duru-⁸¹ may mediate between the contending readings in
the line Turpis et in lepido limine sommas erit (al. tristis).
See the commentators on the passages in Virgil, and compare
χάλκεος ὕπνος, Hom. Il. ll. 241.

153. sic volo: ‘that’s as I would have it, says Mercury,
probably tightening his girdle for a fight. There can be little
doubt that sic volo is the true reading. Cf. Ter. A d. 2. 1. 15,
em, sic volo (Aeschinus preparing his man to beat Sannio).
The MSS. rather point to sic colo, which XVeise explains to mean,
‘that’s my way !’ ‘that’s the sort of man I am'3 and Poen.
prol. 13, Exerce vocem, quam per viri-sque et colis, is quoted in
its favour 3 but cluis, Scaliger⁷s conjecture, is probably right
there.

154. Cingitur, ‘girding himself,’ that is girding up his
dress, not, of course, putting on the cestus.

non feret quin vapulet, ⁶ he shall not carry it off without a
beating‚’ Cf. Ter. Heaut. 5. 1. 45, αῖ ην· illud haud inultum
δι’ vivo firent; Ad. 3. 4. 8, haud sic auferent ,· Shakespeare‚
Rom. and Jul. Act 3. Sc. 1, ‘ a la stoccata carries it away.'

155. Quis homo is. like τίς ἀνήρ 111 Greek, a very common
phrase in Latin comedy. Ter. Ad. 5. 5. 2: ΑΜΖ. 2. 2. 7: 4. 1. 39.

159. tractim tangam, ut dormiat? ‘stroke him down gently
so that he may sleep'3 tractim denotes a long slow stroke.
